years when the iowa caucuses and new hampshire primary roll around the critics and cynics question why such unrepresentative patches of america get to vote first in presidential nominating contests why is so much political power they complain given to states that are more white and more rural than the rest of the country so we attempted to quantitatively evaluate the critique — and try to come up with which states actually were the most representative of the average of the entire country in what we e calling the perfect state index in creating the psi we looked at five categories race education age income and religion  e explain the methodology how we arrived there and analyze each category in detail further down  below is an interactive table which you can sort the results by category so which states came out on top the overall winner illinois race illinois education delaware age virginia income pennsylvania religion  ie florida indiana iowa north dakota methodology — why we chose these five factors it  complicated and true our metrics are somewhat arbitrary there are a dozen ways  r more you could slice and dice census data to decide which demographic factors are most important but we felt that in terms of understanding political behavior — these five indicators were the most important we ran the data by bill frey a demographer with the brookings institution and he insisted that of all the factors we were considering race was by far the most important indicator of political behavior sign up for npr  politics newsletter  ace is one where there  a sharp divide between how whites vote and how most minorities vote  frey said  he race classification   is a really good indicator to understand something about how elections are going to turn out  and frey encouraged us to place a higher priority on race because it often correlates with income education and perhaps even religion  y that i mean — in a state like mississippi which has a relatively high black population that may also have some bearing on mississippi  income rank and on its education rank  frey explained  ississippi has the lowest median household income in the country as you can see from our table  so with frey  guidance we decided to give a little more power to the  ace category  ll the other categories are not weighted  for each of our five indicators we compared every state in the country to either the u  median value or the percentage of the national population that allowed us to see how far each state diverged from the quintessential american  iddle  so for example in the map below you l notice that both california  8  percent white and maine  3  percent white fared poorly on the race index but for obviously different reasons our index looks at the absolute value — it doesn  matter whether a state is better or worse than the u  average it matters how much a state differs from  ainstream america for each category every state received a ranking from 1 to 50 we then added the individual rankings together to give each state a final score below you l see which state ranked the highest in the five individual categories race we analyzed 2014 u  census data to compare the racial make p of each state to the country as a whole we included all the categories the census uses black or african merican american indian or alaska native asian ative hawaiian and other pacific islander two or more races hispanic or latino and white alone not hispanic or latino and the reason we used the census subcategories is that it gives us a more accurate racial portrait of each state if we had only looked at  inorities compared to  hites  we would have gotten a skewed picture for example had we ranked solely based on  inority population combining all the racial subgroups alaska would have ranked near the top but it has a disproportionately large native american population a group which has a relatively minor voting effect on american politics at a national level we wanted to find a state that more closely mirrors the country  racial portrait — and illinois does that almost perfectly if you look at every group latinos asians blacks — illinois respective populations are nearly identical to the country  at large that doesn  surprise frey from brookings he points out that illinois has mirrored the country  historical mass migrations first white ethnic immigrant groups such as those from polish and italian ancestry moved to the state then during the great migration of the early 20th century african mericans from the south settled in chicago and then in the last 30 to 40 years thousands of hispanics particularly mexicans moved to the city  nd all of that is due to that fact that chicago has been this kind of central place that has been emblematic of these different kinds of movements  frey explained   don  think there  any other metropolitan area or any other state really that has all of these elements   different parts of the country have had pieces of these things but chicago has had them all in different sequences and so right now we have a snapshot of a metropolitan area that  a lot like the u  population  and as blacks latinos and asians diversified the city frey said old urban white ethnics moved to the suburbs and the rural farmlands he added that the mix of urban and rural coupled with white suburbanization makes illinois a good bellwether of what  gone on in the united states as a whole in recent decades education we looked at the percent of the population that was older than 25 in each state with a bachelor  degree or higher as tracked by census data between 2010 and 2014 minorities of all educational levels tend to vote democratic but as we e written elsewhere there seems to be a growing political educational divide within the white population in delaware 29  percent of the total population has graduated with bachelor  degree or higher  n the u  as a whole 29  percent has at least a bachelor  degree  frey said delaware  mainstream evel of education may be due to its geography  t  an important state but it is considered to be kind of a suburb of philadelphia writ large  he said  nd increasingly college graduates have been living and moving to the suburbs and that  part of what delaware is as well  he was perhaps more intrigued by the next few highly ranked states  ou also see in this list states you might not have expected to see there — montana nebraska oregon  frey said  t shows this median level of education is pretty pervasive in all different parts of the country not just concentrated in a few places  age we used 2014 census data to compare the median age in each state to the u  median age of 37   t  good to know that virginia is in the middle  said frey but he  skeptical that it means much because there are a clump of states that roughly reflect the u  median age what  more important are the states toward the bottom of the list  hat you want to look at — is states that are kind of on the extremes  frey added  nd when you e thinking of the extremes you e thinking of some of the new england states pennsylvania west virginia – those are states that a lot of the young people have left over the years  and that brings us to new hampshire the early voting state is one of the oldest in the country  ied with vermont for 47th on the age index  in fact the aging population has even become a concern for voters in the state at a recent campaign event one woman described new hampshire as going through a  ilver tsunami  for election purposes frey says the 65 and older population is key  hose are the kinds of populations  he noted  t least in recent elections  hat have tended to veer more toward republican candidates in presidential elections  and they vote frey added that a state  median age is often indicative of recent regional migration patterns   lot of immigrants have come to parts of the country and made their populations younger  he said   lot of it is in the south and the west  and indeed immigration may help explain why virginia did so well in the age category when its neighbor west virginia did so poorly income there are lots of different economic indicators we could have used to measure the  ealth of a state the unemployment rate the percent of people who own houses or median household income with the advice of our economics editor marilyn geewax we opted to go with the 2010 to 2014 median household income  n 2014 dollars  for the country at large that is  3 82 income is a tough measure because the cost of living differs wildly from mississippi to manhattan but it  also an important metric because the economy is so often the most important issue for voters pennsylvania  income levels are so incredibly average that it differed from the u  median by less than a percent frey points to pennsylvania  geography and mix of urban suburban rural communities as a possible explanation for economic diversity  ennsylvania   has the average of those urban areas like philadelphia and pittsburgh  frey said  nd then  n the inner part of the state it  a little more rural  interestingly the first nominating state of iowa also ranked high on the average ncome calculator coming in third but frey thinks iowa fared well for different reasons — partly because it  an overwhelmingly white state and partly because it  in the middle of the country with an average cost of living the states that did poorly also tell us something important new jersey and maryland were 49th and 50th respectively both states are wealthier and largely overgrown suburbs of new york and philadelphia  n new jersey  case and washington d   when it comes to the population center of south entral maryland  t  suburban new york and suburban d   and some pretty rich suburbs  frey said  ome of the richest suburban counties in the country are in new jersey and maryland  and so even though new jersey and maryland did well on other metrics such as race or age they didn  do well in the overall psi because of income religion there was a four ay tie for first place in the religion index and that  partly because the data isn  as nuanced statistics for all the other categories were collected and compiled through the census bureau but the census doesn  ask americans about religion given the central role of religion in campaign politics and the degree to which religiosity predicts political behavior we thought it was an important metric to include to assess  eligiosity  which can often be an amorphous attitude in itself we used data from the 2014 religious landscape study  a comprehensive survey conducted by the pew research center which interviewed more than 35 00 americans from all 50 states we looked at a one specific aspect of this study the percent of adults in each state who said religion was  ery important in their lives in the u  as a whole and in iowa in particular 53 percent of adults said religion was  ery important in their lives as iowa prays so prays the country   apparently iowa  mainstream status on the religious index might seem surprising given the extent to which the white christian conservative vote is courted by gop presidential candidates there but there two things to keep in mind the definition of an evangelical is murky as npr  danielle kurtzleben has previously reported  and the gop caucus attracts religious activists so the evangelical community  real numbers are over nflated in media reports on the democratic side religion is essentially a non ssue and in both 2008 and 2012 president obama won iowa in the general election so while people might think of iowa as a religious state it  only actually as a whole as religious as the country in fact there are many other states that are far more religious think alabama where 77 percent of people said religion was  ery important in their lives new hampshire on the other hand is far more secular new hampshire came in 46th in the category of people saying that religion was  ery important to them just 33 percent of adults in new hampshire said religion was  ery important to them and 36 percent described themselves as  eligiously unaffiliated  which means they don  identify with any organized religion it  one of the least religious states in the country second only to sen bernie sanders home state of vermont illinois — perfectly average illinois borders a traditional east est divide in the country — the mississippi river it snakes across the state  western edge separating it from iowa and it  a microcosm of the country in nearly ever category specifically it ranked in the top 10 for race age and religion it  almost comical that the most perfectly average state neighbors iowa the state that gets to go first in presidential nominating contests in many ways illinois is geographically and demographically similar to iowa particularly in the southern and western regions of the state the major difference is chicago — an urban core the kind iowa just doesn  have  t  as diverse as the country but not overly diverse  frey said  t  probably a little more urban than the country as a whole because of the greater chicago metropolitan area but a lot of that is the suburbs and the suburbs are representative of much of america  plus he added illinois also has a  ural component which is important   illinois   may not be a swing state  frey said  ut in terms of its demographics i think people would do well to look at how the voting goes there to get a better understanding of what  going on in the country as a whole  and while people might think of illinois as a blue state it currently has a republican governor and a republican senator albeit one who will be in a tough re lection fight in a presidential year also it  only fairly recently since 1992 that the state started voting reliably for democrats in presidential years from 1968 to 1988 illinois voted consistently republican in fact illinois record is more accurate than partisan throughout the 20th century illinois voted for the winner in every presidential election with the exception of two woodrow wilson in 1916 and jimmy carter in 1976 if anything frey says perhaps illinois is a racial bellwether in 2014 the country  under ge  population became majority inority  and so in years to come frey said the racial makeup of the rest of the country is likely going to look more similar to illinois a reality check on iowa and new hampshire iowa the state that goes first in our current political system according to the psi came in 16th place overall that  not too bad considering it could have been worse new hampshire for example was 49th nearly dead last to be fair iowa is representative of the country on most of our metrics with the exception of race a number of states east coasters derisively refer to as  lyover states — nebraska kansas iowa and missouri — actually all fared quite well on the psi especially if race was excluded so in some ways it seems the heartland is a fairly accurate portrait of average america if it was more racially diverse but race is such an important factor that frey thinks it outweighs iowa  advantages in the race category iowa was in the bottom 10 finishing 40th with just a 3  percent black population and a 5  percent hispanic population new hampshire though is even more of an outlier the only state that fared worse overall was west virginia by every measure new hampshire is horribly unrepresentative of the country — people make too much money they e graying over ducated overwhelmingly white and not nearly religious enough the question of course is whether these two states should continue to serve as litmus tests for candidates  t  for the parties to decide  frey said  ut i have to say as a demographer the more stock you put into these two states as we become more diverse as a country the more we l be out of touch with what the rest of the country  going to be voting like  facebook twitter flipboard email read  mp listen home news arts  mp life music podcasts programs connect newsletters facebook twitter instagram contact help about npr overview
