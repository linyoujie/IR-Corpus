strategist grub street health 3 7 p  everything to know about coronavirus in the united states by claire lampen  laire ampen mike pence commander of the u  coronavirus task force for some reason photo eric baradat fp via getty images last week the centers for disease control and prevention warned that the united states should brace for a domestic coronavirus outbreak  with the director of its national center for immunization and respiratory diseases explaining that "it 's not so much of a question of if this will happen in this country any more but a question of when this will happen  globally the case count for this pneumonia ike disease has topped 85 00 across every continent except antarctica with over 3 00 deaths so far the vast majority of these have occurred in mainland china where the spread of the virus began but on march 1 the u  reported its first novel coronavirus elated death in washington state more deaths have been reported since here 's everything we know about the spread of the virus in the u  so far how many new coronarvirus cases have been confirmed in the u   as of march 2 there were 91 confirmed cases of the new coronavirus — the who has officially named the disease that this virus causes covid 9 — across the u  most of these people recently traveled to china or were released from quarantine aboard the diamond princess cruise ship  which experienced an outbreak last month increasingly though new cases have cropped up in people who have no known association with outbreak epicenters suggesting that the virus is spreading undetected through person o erson contact and has been for weeks covid 9 cases have been confirmed in washington state oregon california arizona utah nebraska texas illinois wisconsin massachusetts rhode island and new york in washington where the first u  coronavirus fatality was reported and two new cases were confirmed on march 1 it 's possible that as many as 1 00 people may have been infected  there 's also an outbreak at a long erm care facility the life care center in kirkland washington where 27 residents and 25 employees reportedly have covid 9 symptoms as of march 2 four of the six u  deaths had occurred at the life care center at this point no u  deaths have been reported outside washington also on march 1 health officials announced rhode island 's first case in a man who recently returned from italy while oregon announced its first "presumptive case " on friday the first case of coronavirus in new york state was confirmed on sunday when governor andrew cuomo released a statement saying the patient a woman in her late 30s had recently traveled to iran where an outbreak is well underway  the woman has been quarantined in her manhattan home "the patient has respiratory symptoms but is not in serious condition and has been in a controlled situation since arriving to new york  said cuomo what are u  health officials doing about coronavirus last week president donald trump put vice resident mike pence — a man with a frankly dismal track record in public health — in charge of the coronavirus response assuring the public that the white house is "very very ready for this " and "there 's a very good chance you 're not going to die " from covid 9 naturally reports from the inside contradict the president 's claims of bureaucratic control with one senior administration official reportedly saying of the squabbling and misinformation allegedly taking place behind the scenes "it 's complete chaos  on sunday health and human services secretary alex azar said that "we will see more cases …  nd we will see continued community spreading in the united states as we 're seeing around the world  still he added hhs would be "ramping up testing … radically over the next couple of weeks  according to azar the country has 75 00 diagnostic kits available meanwhile the food and drug administration announced that it would give labs and hospitals the green light to test for the virus rather than relying solely on the cdc for analysis in late january azar announced a mandatory quarantining policy applicable to all passengers on u  flights who 'd visited china 's hubei province where the virus is believed to have originated within the past 14 days additionally he said screening checkpoints would be established at seven major airports nationwide at the same time trump announced that the government would be "temporarily suspending the entry into the united states of foreign nationals " who have traveled to china within that same time period meanwhile the fbi has placed a  0 00 bulk order of hand sanitizer and face masks "in case the coronavirus becomes a pandemic in the united states  what should i do to minimize my coronavirus risk in most cases covid 9 is not fatal but it appears to pose the greatest risk to elderly people very very young people and people with preexisting conditions that compromise their immune systems  octors and medical workers may also be at greater risk due to their higher han verage odds of exposure  because the cdc anticipates a sharp uptick in domestic transmission though it is urging people to prepare for the worst stock up on supplies — medicine non erishable foods toilet paper etc — and fastidiously wash your hands  face masks have been selling out online and in stores but the surgeon general has pleaded with people to stop buying them surgical masks don 't do much to keep out disease preading particles and the masks that do seem to help — n95 facial respirators — are recommended only for people who are already infected or for health are workers and caregivers people wearing masks as a preventive measure may be taking valuable and limited resources away from those who actually need them if you do find yourself in need of an n95 respirator and you have creative facial hair the cdc also has thoughts on which mustache styles will be safest in a pandemic if you have symptoms associated with coronavirus — coughing fever respiratory issues — call your doctor before simply showing up at their office the virus is highly contagious and you want to limit the possibility of spreading it bearing in mind that right now the odds are better that you simply have a cold or the flu  hich is also serious and many health experts would advise you to get a flu shot  still if you are sick the cdc recommends that you stay home and self solate confining yourself to one room as much as possible and wearing a face mask when you have to interact with others wash your hands frequently — soap and water and at least 20 seconds of scrubbing — and avoid touching shared household items cleaning "high ouch " surfaces regularly your health are provider and even local health department will help you determine how long it 's appropriate for you to keep up these precautions regardless of whether or not you have symptoms though keep your hands clean and seriously stop touching your face  this post
