audacious vision But there were surprising moments along the way and not everything went as expected Author History om Editors NASA It was a feat for the ages Just seven years before a young president had challenged the nation to land a man on the moon x2014 ot because it was  x201C asy  201D as John F Kennedy said in 1962  but because it was  x201C ard  201D By July 20 1969 Neil Armstrong backed down a ladder and onto the moon x2019  surface Along the way to achieving JFK pos  vision there was plenty of hard work drama and surprise Here are some lesser nown moments throughout the epic U  effort to reach the moon 13 Gallery 13 Images 1 Moon dirt smells A big question facing the NASA team planning the Apollo 11 moon landing was what would the moon x2019  surface be like x2014 ould the lander x2019  legs touch down on firm ground or sink into something soft The surface turned out to be solid but the real surprise was that the moon had a smell Moon soil is extremely clingy and hard to brush off so when Armstrong and Aldrin returned to the lunar module and repressurized it lunar dirt that had clung to the men x2019  suits entered the cabin and began to emit an odor The astronauts reported that it had a burned smell like wet fireplace ashes or like the air after a fireworks show Scientists would never get the chance to investigate just what the crew was smelling While moon soil and rock samples were sent to labs in sealed containers once they were opened back on Earth the smell was gone Somehow as Charles Fishman author of One Giant Leap  says  x201C he smell of the moon remained on the moon  201D Watch video  A0 Apollo 11 What the Moon Smells Like 2 JFK was more focused on beating the Soviets than in space In public President John F Kennedy had boldly pledged that the United States would  x201C et sail on this new sea because there is new knowledge to be gained and new rights to be won and they must be won and used for the progress of all people quot But secret tapes of Kennedy x2019  discussions would later reveal that in private JFK was less interested in space exploration than in one pping the Soviets In a 1962 meeting with advisors and NASA administrators  JFK confessed  uot  pos  not that interested in space quot But he was interested in winning the Cold War  Just months after JFK x2019  inauguration the Soviet Union had sent the first man into space  A0 ennedy asked his vice president Lyndon B Johnson how the U  could score a win against the Soviets One of the best ways to show U  dominance Johnson reported back was by sending a manned mission to the moon Johnson in fact had long been a space advocate saying in 1958   A0 quot ontrol of space is control of the world quot Watch video  A0 Apollo 11 JFK x2019  Secret Space Tapes 3 The Soviets covered up their efforts to get to the moon first It turns out that the United States wasn x2019  alone in wanting to demonstrate its dominance by landing humans on the moon The Soviet Union was also gunning to accomplish the feat But once U  astronauts got there first the Soviets tried to keep their efforts on the down ow At first  x201C ecrecy was necessary so that no one would overtake us  201D wrote journalist Yaroslav Golovanov in the Soviet newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda   x201C ut later when they did overtake us we had to maintain secrecy so that no one knew that we had been overtaken  201D Read more  A0 The Soviet Response to the Moon Landing Denial  4 Astronauts trained for microgravity by walking  x201C ideways  201D How do you prepare to send someone to a place no one has ever gone before For NASA in the 1960s the answer was to create simulations that mimicked aspects of what astronauts could expect to encounter Armstrong and Aldrin rehearsed collecting samples on fake indoor moonscapes Armstrong practiced taking off and landing in the Lunar Landing Training Vehicle in Houston And to simulate walking in the moon x2019  lower ravity atmosphere astronauts were suspended sideways by straps and then walked along a tilted wall NASA and the U  Geological Survey even blasted out craters at Cinder Lake Arizona to create a landscape that matched part of the moon x2019  surface x2014 ecause after all practice makes perfect A test subject being suited up for studies on the Reduced Gravity Walking Simulator at Langley Research Center 1963 NASA

on the moon A few days before the scheduled launch of Apollo 11 a group of activists led by civil rights leader Ralph Abernathy arrived outside the gates of the Kennedy Space Center They brought with them two mules and a wooden wagon to illustrate the contrast between the gleaming white Saturn V rocket and families who couldn x2019  afford food or a decent place to live Amid the heady build p to the launch the NASA administrator Thomas Paine came out to talk to the protestors face o ace After Paine and Abernathy talked for a while under lightly falling rain Paine said he hoped Abernathy would  x201C itch his wagons to our rocket using the space program as a spur to the nation to tackle problems boldly in other areas and using NASA x2019  space successes as a yardstick by which progress in other areas should be measured  201D Paine then arranged to have members of the group attend the next day x2019  launch from a VIP viewing area Abernathy prayed for the safety of the astronauts and said he was as proud as anyone at the accomplishment Bettmann Archive etty Images Read more Why Civil Rights Leaders Protested the Moon Landing  xA0 6 Buzz Aldrin took holy communion on the moon When

advancement of humanity Armstrong Aldrin and Collins had the dubious pleasure of being stuck in planetary protection quarantine on their return Since humans had never been to the moon before NASA scientists couldn x2019  be sure that some deadly space orne plague hadn x2019  hitched a ride on the astronauts As soon as their re ntry capsule splashed down in the Pacific Ocean on July 24 the trio was transferred to a mobile quarantine facility inside which they were transported to NASA Lunar Receiving Laboratory at Johnson Space Center where they had access to a larger quarantine facility
