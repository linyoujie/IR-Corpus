  share this slideshow direct link introduced to the world on feb 14 1946 the eniac   electronic numerical integrator and computer   was developed by the university of pennsylvania  john mauchly and j presper ecker t under a 1943 contract with the u  army it was the world  first large cale electronic general urpose digital computer  and its development was the birth of large computing systems that dominated the industry for years to come here we take a quick look at its development and history idg news service eniac was developed under a 1943 contract with the u  army to speed ballistics calculations it was built under total secrecy and completed only after wwii however at 30 feet by 60 feet weighing 30 tons and using 19 00 vacuum tubes eniac was the epitome of a large system eniac

50th anniversary of the eniac which the university then ran for the first time in four decades goldstine passed away in 2004 a significant part of eniac  history is the six women who programmed it  their ballistics program used hundreds of wires and 3 00 switches at the time they were not introduced only to be seen in pictures rear from left kathy kleiman jean bartik marlyn meltzer kay mauchly antonelli front betty holberton idg news service jean bartik  hown on the left gained fame as one of the lead programmers of eniac bartik was quoted as saying   was just at the right place at the right time it was divine providence or fate that selected me to be an eniac programmer  she received honors such as a pioneer award from the ieee computer society and was inducted into the computer history museum as well bartik went on to work on other early computers such as the binac and univac i bartik passed away in 2011 idg news service according to a document from the university of pennsylvania patent issues became a problem the university had a policy barring faculty from obtaining private patents based on university research but the eniac was supported through military funding after world war ii the military wanted academic institutions seeking research contracts to have uniform patent policies so the university demanded that mauchly and eckert give their patent rights back having done the work of filing the patent mauchly and eckert did not oblige this decision ultimately led to their resignations in march 1946 mauchly and eckert ultimately formed the electronic controls company in philadelphia and in 1950 sold their company to remington rand which ultimately became part of unisys with remington rand the inventors helped develop the first univac computer which was  delivered to the census bureau in june 1951 unlike the eniac the univac processed each digit serially but its much higher design speed permitted it to add two 10 igit numbers at a rate of almost 100 00 additions per second internally the univac operated at a clock frequency of 2 5 mhz which was no mean feat for vacuum tube circuits  according to the university of pennsylvania in 1995 a group of upenn electrical engineering students built an  niac n  hip as part of eniac  50th anniversary celebration they integrated the whole  niac on a 7 4 y  9 quare illimeter chip using a 0
