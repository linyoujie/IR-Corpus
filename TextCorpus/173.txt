unveiled an old map on monday that he and some supporters say should topple one of the central tenets of western civilization that europeans were the first to sail around the world and discover america the chinese map which was drawn in 1763 but has a note on it saying it is a reproduction of a map dated 1418 presents the world as a globe with all the major continents rendered with an exactitude that european maps did not have for at least another century after columbus da gama magellan dias and others had completed their renowned explorations but the map got a cool reception from some chinese scholars and seems unlikely to persuade skeptics that chinese seamen were the first to round the world liu gang a partner in a well nown beijing law firm and an amateur historian said monday that he bought the map for  00 in a shanghai book store in 2001 and only subsequently discovered its value he said he had consulted scholars in the field and had done extensive research of his own before deciding to present his findings to the public  uot he main issue is not the map itself quot he said at a news conference  uot t is the potential of the information in the map to change history quot at issue are the seven voyages of zheng he whose ships sailed the pacific and indian oceans from 1405 to 1433 historical records show that he explored southeast asia india the persian gulf and the east coast of africa using navigational techniques and ships that were far ahead of their time but a small group of scholars and hobbyists led by gavin menzies a former british navy submarine commander argue that zheng he traveled much farther than most chinese and western scholars say notably mr menzies claims that zheng he visited america in 1421 71 years before columbus arrived there his 2003 book entitled  uot 421 the year china discovered america uot  illiam morrow arpercollins  laid out extensive but widely disputed evidence that zheng he sailed to the east coast of today x27  united states in 1421 and may have left settlements in south america mr menzies has welcomed mr liu x27  map as evidence that his theory is correct and the two have cooperated in efforts to demonstrate its authenticity strictly speaking mr liu credits zheng he with having navigated and charted the americas at least several years before mr menzies says he sailed there though both say that is a minor contradiction zheng he x27  achievements have been the subject of speculation for years partly because much of the historical record was destroyed when later chinese emperors changed their minds about the wisdom of connecting with the outside world last year china x27  communist government commemorated the 600th anniversary of zheng he x27  better known voyages but beijing has not actively promoted the idea that he sailed far beyond asian and african shores if the map genuinely dates to 1418 it reveals knowledge of longitude and latitude and the basic shape of the world including the fact that it is round that could not have come from european sources and could have been derived only from zheng he x27  voyages mr liu says he referred to 15th entury books and memorial inscriptions and 16th entury maps that credit earlier chinese discoveries among a variety of indirect evidence to support his thesis but mr liu acknowledged that he had no hard evidence of the existence of a 1418 map beyond the word of the mapmaker who said he made the copy in the late 18th century a time when all of its cartographical achievements would have been commonplace gong yingyan a historian at zhejiang university and a leading map expert argues that the map is too full of anachronisms to date from the 15th century he said for example that chinese cartographers did not use the style of projection seen in mr liu x27  map   the rendering of a three imensional globe on a flat sheet   until after europeans introduced that technique to the chinese much later the map x27  chinese notes about the cultures religious and racial features of people in the continents of the world also contain vocabulary that would have been unfamiliar to a reader in the early 15th century he said he cited the term the map uses for the western god which he said was not used until after the jesuits arrived in china in the 16th century  uot  had high hopes when i first heard about the existence of such a map quot mr gong said  uot ut i can see now that it is an entirely ordinary map that proves nothing quot advertisement continue reading the main story site index go to home page » news home
