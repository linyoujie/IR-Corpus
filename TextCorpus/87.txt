long a day on venus lasts finding the answer cuts to the core of fundamental mysteries about the planet by nola taylor redd january 3 2020 11 0 pm this composite image of the cloud overed planet venus

sign up for the newsletter sign up for over 50 years humans have tried to pull back the thick clouds of venus to study its surface most observations have tapped the long wavelengths of radar to pierce the cloud layers now scientists have combined long erm radar observations of the planet 's surface to try to clarify a longstanding mystery behind the length of venus x27 day n earth it x27  easy to measure how long a day lasts you simply pick a feature and track how long it takes for the sun to return to the same position venus isn 't so simple on venus a day lasts about 243 earth ays that x27  longer than it takes the planet to complete an orbit around the sun so a venusian year actually spans just 225 earth ays the clouds make things even more challenging they cover the surface and make it difficult to locate features till thanks to radar and spacecraft like nasa x27  magellan mission which spent four years visiting venus in the early 1990s astronomers thought they had a handle on the length of a venus day but when the european space agency x27  venus express mission returned to the world a team of scientists found something odd in  research published in 2012  they showed that the average rotation period between 1991 and 2007 was shorter than the average rotation period measured by magellan between 1991 and 1993 the mystery makes it challenging to understand what x27  happening on the planet x27  surface information that can help explain why a world that started out so much like earth turned into an extreme hotbox the lack of knowledge could also make it difficult to send a lander to venus even though that goal has recently gained significant scientific support now researchers have combined almost 30 years of earth ased observations of venus to calculate an average rotation rate for the planet the new average is slower than the average calculated by magellan over a significantly shorter observation period of 487 days  uot enus express only saw that yes there was a difference but there was fairly large uncertainty quot said study author and planetary scientist bruce campbell of the smithsonian institution in washington d   uot e x27 e brought that uncertainty down to a much finer level quot the new results suggest that over the course of 29 years from 1988 to 2017 the average rotation of venus was 243 days 30  minutes that contrasts with magellan x27  average of 243 days 26  minutes  uot deally you x27  like to be able to measure things precisely year to year quot campbell said  uot f major interest is how  hose measurements affect the long erm prediction of where a point on the surface is going to be quot he said in other words if you want to drop a robotic explorer in a region of the planet you need to know how quickly that point is spinning both magellan and  venus express  watched the planet in detail for only a few brief years the new measurements which were published in the journal  icarus  take a step back to look at the spin over decades using the arecibo observatory in puerto rico and the green bank observatory in west virginia while they don x27  nail down how the planet x27  spin changes from year to year they provide a long erm average that can be useful for visiting spacecraft one that fits both spacecraft measurements  uot f 20 years out we want to land on a certain place on venus i want to be sure my prediction is as solid as possible quot campbell said  uot  wouldn x27  want to predict 20 years out then find out that the landing site is 5 10 15 kilometers away quot venus ' changing days long before spacecraft visited venus earth ased telescopes were already trying to unveil its mysteries in the 1960s scientists used radar to determine that the planet spins backward compared to its orbit which astronomers call retrograde rotation over the next 20 years astronomers kept tracking venus ' features in an effort to pin down the length of a day so when magellan arrived at venus its measurement of the planet 's day was already almost 5 minutes longer than the radar measurements nearly 20 years later venus express set the day back 7 minutes closer to the original calculations made by earth ased instruments so what x27  changing the planet x27  rotation rate previous studies have shown that the heavy atmosphere far thicker than earth x27  can affect the planet x27  spin gravitational tugs from earth and the sun may also play a role in changing the length of the day that means any given day on venus  hich again lasts 243 earth days might be slightly longer or shorter than the one before depending on the weather venus won 't stop spinning these changes aren x27  necessarily permanent while the new research reveals a different average day length from previous measurements campbell and his colleagues caution that their findings don x27  mean the planet will one day stop spinning overall the spin of venus is determined by a balance between the sun x27  tidal pull on the atmosphere as well as on the solid planet itself  uot e do not know if venus x27 rotation is slowing down or speeding up quot says jean uc margot a planetary scientist at ucla who was part of the new findings  uot n fact venus x27 spin rate may very well be speeding up at this time quot part of the problem with sorting out the planet x27  rotation comes from lack of precision  uot or venus we don x27  have highly precise measurements quot said nils mueller a researcher at the german aerospace center who led the 2012 research because spacecraft have landed on their surfaces mars and the moon have much tighter rotational measurements campbell would like to see that sort of precision used on venus in the 1970s apollo astronauts left behind mirrors on the lunar surface that let researchers shoot a laser beam from earth to the moon and back martian landers have had radio signals that transmit their position back to earth both allow precision measurements of rotation  uot e don x27  have either of those for venus quot campbell said that may change in the near future  uot here x27  a lot of excitement these days to go back to venus quot campbell said nasa is exploring a proposed mission called veritas or venus emissivity radio science insar topography and spectroscopy which would create a high esolution map of the planet the european space agency also has a mission proposal called envision like veritas envision would perform high esolution radar mapping  uot hose would both give you significant improvement in image resolution over magellan quot campbell said
