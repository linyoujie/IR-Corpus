gravity overview of gravity with a focus on zero gravity contunico © zdf enterprises gmbh mainz see all videos for this article gravity  also called gravitation  in mechanics  the universal force of attraction acting between all matter it is by far the weakest known force in nature and thus plays no role in determining the internal properties of everyday matter on the other hand through its long reach and universal action it controls the trajectories of bodies in the solar system and elsewhere in the universe and the structures and evolution of stars galaxies and the whole cosmos  on earth all bodies have a weight  or downward force of gravity proportional to their mass which earth 's mass exerts on them gravity is measured by the acceleration that it gives to freely falling objects at earth 's surface the acceleration of gravity is about 9  metres  2 feet per second per second thus for every second an object is in free fall its speed increases by about 9  metres per second at the surface of the moon the acceleration of a freely falling body is about 1  metres per second per second gravitational lens as observed by the hubble space telescope n this picture a galactic cluster about five billion light ears away produces a tremendous gravitational field that "bends " light around it this lens produces multiple copies of a blue galaxy about twice as distant four images are visible in a circle surrounding the lens a fifth is visible near the centre of the picture photo aura tsci asa pl  asa photo  stsci rc96 0 the works of isaac newton and albert einstein dominate the development of gravitational theory newton 's classical theory of gravitational force held sway from his principia  published in 1687 until einstein 's work in the early 20th century newton 's theory is sufficient even today for all but the most precise applications einstein 's theory of general relativity predicts only minute quantitative differences from the newtonian theory except in a few special cases the major significance of einstein 's theory is its radical conceptual departure from classical theory and its implications for further growth in physical thought the launch of space vehicles and developments of research from them have led to great improvements in measurements of gravity around earth other planets and the moon and in experiments on the nature of gravitation development of gravitational theory early concepts newton argued that the movements of celestial bodies and the free fall of objects on earth are determined by the same force the classical greek philosophers on the other hand did not consider the celestial bodies to be affected by gravity because the bodies were observed to follow perpetually repeating nondescending trajectories in the sky thus aristotle considered that each heavenly body followed a particular "natural " motion unaffected by external causes or agents aristotle also believed that massive earthly objects possess a natural tendency to move toward earth 's centre those aristotelian concepts prevailed for centuries along with two others that a body moving at constant speed requires a continuous force acting on it and that force must be applied by contact rather than interaction at a distance these ideas were generally held until the 16th and early 17th centuries thereby impeding an understanding of the true principles of motion and precluding the development of ideas about universal gravitation this impasse began to change with several scientific contributions to the problem of earthly and celestial motion which in turn set the stage for newton 's later gravitational theory get exclusive access to content from our 1768 first edition with your subscription subscribe today the 17th entury german astronomer johannes kepler accepted the argument of nicolaus copernicus  hich goes back to aristarchus of samos  that the planets orbit the sun  not earth using the improved measurements of planetary movements made by the danish astronomer tycho brahe during the 16th century kepler described the planetary orbits with simple geometric and arithmetic relations kepler 's three quantitative laws of planetary motion are the planets describe elliptic orbits of which the sun occupies one focus   focus is one of two points inside an ellipse  any ray coming from one of them bounces off a side of the ellipse and goes through the other focus  the line joining a planet to the sun sweeps out equal areas in equal times the square of the period of revolution of a planet is proportional to the cube of its average distance from the sun during this same period the italian astronomer and natural philosopher galileo galilei made progress in understanding "natural " motion and simple accelerated motion for earthly objects he realized that bodies that are uninfluenced by forces continue indefinitely to move and that force is necessary to change motion not to maintain constant motion in studying how objects fall toward earth galileo discovered that the motion is one of constant acceleration  he demonstrated that the distance a falling body travels from rest in this way varies as the square of the time as noted above the acceleration due to gravity at the surface of earth is about 9  metres per second per second galileo was also the first to show by experiment that bodies fall with the same acceleration whatever their composition  he weak principle of equivalence  gravity quick facts key people kip s thorne isaac newton galileo john archibald wheeler simon stevin pierre bouguer albert of
