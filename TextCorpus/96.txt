our best way of understanding the universe by devin powell may 24 2019 3 1 pm a phenomenon known as an  uot instein ring uot created when light is bent by gravity around a large object in this case the large red galaxy in the middle is causing light from a much more distant blue galaxy directly behind it to be bent around into the shape of a ring  redit esa ubble asa newsletter sign up for our

the universe am i  the ship has no windows its instruments are dead the only clue is the push of the chair against her body phew there 's gravity she thinks her vessel must still be on earth but then a second possibility occurs to her the ship could be accelerating through space pressing her into the seat like a race car picking up speed from inside the vessel there is — terrifyingly — no way to tell this spacefarer 's dilemma would have been familiar to albert einstein his 1915 general theory of relativity built on the notion that gravity and acceleration are not just easily confused but are one and the same this equivalence "the happiest thought " of einstein 's life was his starting point for redefining gravity general relativity grew out of einstein 's theory of special relativity which describes how the speed of light  n a vacuum can always be constant according to relativity anything that can happen inside of a box picking up speed — i   accelerating — also happens in the presence of gravity imagine for example a horizontal laser inside an elevator that 's accelerating upward as the light travels sideways the elevator rises causing the beam to strike a spot on the wall slightly lower than where it started if the elevator accelerates quickly enough the beam visibly bends toward the floor einstein showed the same thing happens to a beam inside a stationary elevator within a powerful gravitational field the gravity bends the light similarly he expected a beam of starlight should bend when passing through the sun 's gravity this prediction proved correct when the stars moved during the 1919 solar eclipse relativity describes why a clock on a satellite ticks a few dozen microseconds faster than a clock on earth without accounting for that discrepancy gps technologies wouldn 't work to link acceleration and gravity in this way einstein overthrew one of his own heroes isaac newton you may have learned that newton described gravity as a force an invisible rubber band that pulls together objects with mass newton 's math did a good job at predicting how everything from projectiles to planets moved — but it kept gravity separate from acceleration einstein argued that gravity isn 't a force at all he described it as a curvature of time and space caused by mass and energy confused the german physicist was too and he struggled with the theory for nearly a decade he got help from mathematician marcel grossmann an old friend who shared his notes when a young einstein skipped class their math laid down in 10 equations explained how gravity could move around objects via a warped reality accelerating without ever feeling any mysterious newtonian forces an apple feeling no force usually stays in the same place  eft  but when gravity curves space and time  ight  as einstein x27  general theory of relativity predicts the fruit winds up on the ground without feeling a force  redit alison mackey iscover collage elements envato elements vanatchanan hutterstock the relative basics the main takeaways behind einstein 's general theory of relativity 1 time and space are neither flat nor fixed they are curved and distorted by mass and energy 2 gravity is not a force but rather a distortion of time and space 3 the effects of gravity are indistinguishable from the effects of acceleration over a small space einstein x27  inspiration for general relativity struck while he was a patent clerk in switzerland in 1907  redit heritage image partnership ltd lamy stock photo einstein 's peculiar predictions relativity makes numerous bizarre predictions many of them experimentally verified they only seem bizarre because we don 't notice them in our daily lives — we live for the most part in newton 's reality but beyond that lies einstein 's universe where gravity bends space and time to its will here are some of the theory 's strangest side effects gravity literally slows down time waves of light emitted by stars stretch out because of this time bending and objects closer to a massive object age more slowly super recise clocks which tick according to the vibrations of atoms have verified that gravity alters time 's flow satellites have shown that rotating celestial bodies twirl the fabric of the cosmos around themselves like honey twisted by a spoon affecting the motion of gyroscopes one prediction solved a long tanding dilemma a weird wobble in mercury 's orbit that newton 's math couldn 't account for  stronomers had initially blamed a hidden planet called vulcan  relativity explained the wonky orbit in terms of the warping of space by the sun 's powerful gravity tiny ripples in reality caused by colliding black holes have tripped sensors in highly sensitive instruments buried
