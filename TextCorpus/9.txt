intelligenceofficer who knew that Herman Göring the Nazi air marshal would findthe American aviator's celebrity irresistible Lindbergh flew to Berlinwith his wife Anne as his co ilot and then along with Smith andanother officer spent a few days meeting German pilots inspectingoperations and even flying several German planes  he group also haddinner at Göring's house where they met his pet lion cub Augie Lindbergh was impressed by what he saw Göring so enjoyed impressing himthat Smith was able to arrange four more visits over the next few years rawing on them Lindbergh sent a dire warning to General Henry  ap rnold the commander of the U  Air Force in 1938"Germany isundoubtedly the most powerful nation in the world in military aviation he wrote"and her margin of leadership is increasing with each monththat passes  Lindbergh was right to sound the alarm about a German military buildup ut he was wrong about the strength of the the Luftwaffe which was notas good as he—or the Nazis—believed it to be It was true that theGermans had more planes than anyone else But as the historian VictorDavis Hanson explains in" The Second World Wars How the First GlobalConflict Was Fought andWon  the Luftwaffe had a number of weaknesses some very fundamental A lackof four ngine bombers for example made it hard for Germany to conducttruly devastating long ange strategic ombing campaigns against enemiesoverseas  he Nazis never succeeded in mass roducing an equivalent toAmerica's B 7 Flying Fortress which was in the air before the war The German Navy had no aircraft carriers which made air supremacyduring naval battles impossible  n total the Axis fielded onlysixteen carriers the Allies a hundred and fifty ive  Germany hadlimited access to oil and thus to aviation fuel and this constrainedthe number of missions the Luftwaffe could fly Unlike the Allies whoexcelled at building tidy concrete runways from scratch as the frontshifted the Germans relied on whatever slapdash rural runways theycould find resulting in more wear and tear on their planes The Nazis were slower than the Allies to replace downed aircraft  heyhad less experience with high olume manufacturing  they were alsoslower to replace fallen pilots  heir aircraft were harder to operate Over time this lower replacement rate eroded then reversed theirinitial numbers advantage They also lagged behind in various otherareas of aviation technology"navigation aids drop tanks self ealingtanks chaff air o urface radar  Some of these factors emerged onlyduring the war But others were clear beforehand and analysts couldhave noticed them In truth Hanson writes Lindbergh and many otherswere"hypnotized by Nazi braggadocio and pageantry  The Nazis wereapparently hypnotized too As a land ased power with a small navy hey needed the Luftwaffe to perform miracles  or instance bombingBritain into submission  They did not see the Luftwaffe realistically hey deluded themselves into believing it could do the impossible"The Second World Wars" takes an unusual approach to its subject Thebook is not a chronological retelling of the conflict but ahigh ltitude statistics aturated overview of the dynamics andconstraints that shaped it Hanson is unusual too he is a classicistand a specialist in military history at Stanford's Hoover Institution here he edits Strategika"an online journal that analyzes ongoingissues of national security in light of conflicts of the past" he'salso an almond farmer and a conservative polemicist whose articles onrace immigration and the decline of agrarian values appear regularlyon National Review's Web site and other places I've long found hispolitical commentary tiresome—but his deeply researched and detailedmilitary analyses are fascinating"The Second World Wars" confinesitself to the latter subject with spectacular results Hanson startswith the idea that the Axis powers were more or less destined to lose hen works backward to understand the reasons for their defeat The bookrevolves around a question highly relevant to our own brewingconfrontation with North Korea Why and how do weaker nations convincethemselves against all evidence to the contrary that they are capableof defeating stronger ones Hanson begins by putting the Second World War in a"classical context Although it was a high ech conflict with newly lethal weapons hewrites it still followed patterns established over millennia"British merican Italian and German soldiers often found themselves fortifyingor destroying the Mediterranean stonework of the Romans Byzantines ranks Venetians and Ottomans  In many instances military plannerson both sides ignored the lessons of the past Some lessons were local t's always been hard to"campaign northward up the narrow backbone ofthe Italian peninsula  for example which is exactly what the Alliesstruggled to do Others were universal Small countries have difficultydefeating big ones because—obviously—bigger countries have more peopleand resources at their disposal Germany Italy and Japan therefore hould have been more concerned about their relatively small sizecompared to their foes History shows that the only way to win a totalwar is to occupy your enemy's capital with infantrymen with whom youcan force regime change Hitler should have paused to ask how with sucha weak navy he planned to cross the oceans and sack London and later ashington At a fundamental level it was a mistake for him to attackcountries whose capitals he had no way to reach In terms of management and logistics the Axis powers were similarly nd sometimes quite conspicuously disadvantaged Before the war theUnited States produced a little more than half of the world's oil Axisleaders should have known this would be a decisive factor in amechanized conflict involving tanks planes and other vehicles  heNazis may have underestimated the importance of fuel because—even thoughthey planned to quickly conquer vast amounts of territory through blitzkrieg —many of their supply lines remained dependent upon horsesfor the duration of the war  In general Allied management was moreflexible—British planners quickly figured out the best way to placeradar installations for example—while the Axis powers with their morehierarchical cultures tended toward rigidity Axis leaders believedthat Fascism could make up the difference by producing more fanaticalsoldiers with more"élan  For a brief time at the beginning of the war llied countries believed this too  here was widespread fear specially of Japanese soldiers  They soon realized that defendingone's homeland against invaders turns pretty much everyone into afanatic In any event Hanson shows that the Second World War hinged to anunprecedented extent upon artillery  At least half of the combat deadof World War II probably fell to artillery or mortar fire"  the Allieshad bigger faster factories and could produce more guns and shells The most significant statistic of the war is the ten o ne advantagein aggregate artillery production  n total over a million large guns njoyed by the British Empire the Soviet Union and the United Statesover the three Axis powers  Russia meanwhile excelled atmanufacturing cheap easily serviceable and quickly manufactured tanks hich by the end of the war were better than the tanks the Nazisfielded Many Allied factories remained beyond the reach of Axis forces here were a few possible turning points in the war had Hitler chosennot to invade Russia or not to declare war on the United States hemight have kept his Continental gains Similarly Japan might havecontented itself with a few local conquests But temperance and Fascismdo not mix and the outsized ambitions of the Axis powers put them on acollision course with the massive geographical managerial andlogistical advantages possessed by the Allies which Hanson suggests hey should have known would be insurmountable The Axis powers fell prey to their own mythmaking they were adept atcreating narratives that made exceedingly unlikely victories seem notjust plausible but inevitable When the Allies perceived just howfar Fascist fantasy diverged from reality they concluded that Axisleaders had brainwashed their citizens and themselves They began torealize that"the destruction of populist ideologies especially thosefueled by claims of racial superiority  would prove"a task far morearduous than the defeat of a sovereign people's military" Advertisement Sober Germans Italians and Japanese in the Allied way of thinking ad to be freed from their own hypnotic adherence to evil even if bysuffering along with theirsoldiers    Death was commonplace in WorldWar II because fascist zealotry and the overwhelming force required toextinguish it would logically lead to Allied self ustifications ofviolence and collective punishment of civilians unthinkable in WorldWar I Hanson explores the specific decision aking processes behind the mostmerciless Allied decisions—"the firebombing of the major German andJapanese cities the dropping of two atomic bombs the Allied anctionedethnic cleansing of millions of German peaking civilians from EasternEurope the absolute end of the idea of Prussia"—while from a higheraltitude pointing out that the delusional ideological fervor thatshaped the beginning of the war shaped its end too Could the Axis and Allied countries have performed a searching lear yed inventory of their respective strengths and weaknesses anddecided beforehand that there was no point in having a world war Couldthe Allies have done this on their own and decided to check Hitler'saggression earlier One of the tragic elements of war in Hanson's view s that it often uncovers a reality that might have been comprehended inadvance and by other means Unfortunately in the years before theSecond World War confusion reigned The Axis countries lived in afantasy world—they believed their own propaganda which argued that forreasons of race and ideology they were unbeatable The Allies eanwhile underestimated their own economic might in the wake of theGreat Depression They allowed themselves to be intimidated by Fascistrhetoric justifiably horrified by the First World War they wanted togive pacifism a chance and so refrained from the flag aving displaysof aggression that might have revealed their true strength whilehoping despite his proclamations to the contrary that Hitler might besatisfied with smaller regional conquests"Most wars since antiquitycan be defined as the result of such flawed prewar assessments ofrelative military and economic strength as well as strategicobjectives  Hanson writes"Prewar Nazi Germany had no accurate idea ofhow powerful were Great Britain the United States and the SovietUnion and the latter had no inkling of the full scope of Hitler'smilitary ambitions It took a world war to educate them all  In a general way Hanson's ideas are reminiscent of the thought of theAustrian economist Friedrich Hayek who saw the market as a kind ofinformation roducing machine Buying and selling Hayek wrote were a"procedure for discovering facts which if the procedure did not exist ould remain unknown or at least would not be used  In National ReviewOnline  Hanson writes that"war is a horrific laboratory experimentthat confirms or rejects vague and inexact prewar guesses about relativestrength or weakness  Seeing war as a tragically destructive form ofinformation discovery makes Hanson think differently about peace Theproblem with peace is that it obscures the realities of relativemilitary strength it's especially important therefore for countriesto flex their muscles during peacetime In the present Hanson favors anaggressive response to North Korea in large part because it might clearup mutual ignorance about everyone's capabilities and intentions Sadly a detailed examination of exactly when and how deterrence avertsconflict is beyond the scope of"The Second World Wars  Instead withan extraordinary array of facts and statistics the book offers anaccount of the fatalism of war Until it begins war is a matter ofchoice After that it's shaped by forces and
