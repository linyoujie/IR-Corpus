Senators from each State  bsp U  Constitution Article I section 3 clause 1 During the summer of 1787 the delegates to the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia established equal representation in the Senate and proportional representation in the House of Representatives Called the  dquo reat Compromise dquo or the  dquo onnecticut Compromise rdquo the unique plan for congressional representation resolved the most controversial aspect of the drafting of the Constitution  bsp In the weeks before the Constitution squo  framers agreed to the compromise the delegates from the states with large populations argued that each state squo  representation in the Senate should correspond to the size of the state  bsp arge tate delegates promoted James Madison squo  Virginia Plan  the document that was the basis for several of the clauses in the Constitution Under this plan the Senate and the House would base their membership on the same proportional  dquo ight of suffrage rdquo That is the number of senators in each state would be determined by its population of free citizens and slaves Large states then stood to gain the most seats in the Senate As justification for this advantage delegates noted that their states contributed more of the nation squo  financial and defensive resources than small states and therefore required a greater say in government Small tate delegates hoped to protect states squo rights within a confederate system of government Fearing the effects of majority rule they demanded equal representation in Congress as was practiced under the Articles of Confederation and assumed in William Paterson squo  New Jersey Plan  In fact some framers threatened to withdraw from the convention if a proportional representation measure passed  bsp Other delegates sought a compromise between large tate and small tate interests As early as 1776 Connecticut squo  Roger Sherman had suggested that Congress represent the people as well as the states During the 1787 convention Sherman proposed that House representation be based on the population while in the Senate the states would be equally represented Benjamin Franklin agreed that each state should have an equal vote in the Senate except in matters concerning money The convention squo  grand committee reported his motion with some modifications to the delegates early in July Madison led the debates against Franklin squo  measure believing it an injustice to the majority of Americans while some small tate delegates were reluctant even to support proportional representation in the House On July 16 delegates narrowly adopted the mixed representation plan giving states equal votes in the Senate within a federal system of government Once delegates established equal representation in the Senate they needed to determine how many senators would represent each state State constitutions offered some guidance Several states designated one senator per county or district while in Delaware there were three senators for each of the three counties Convention delegates did not refer to the state precedents in debate however Instead they seemed to take a common ense approach in deciding the number of senators According to constitutional commentator Joseph Story  779 845  few if any delegates considered one senator per state sufficient representation Lone senators might leave their state unrepresented in times of illness or absence and would have no colleague to consult with on state issues Additional senators moreover would increase the size of the Senate making it a more knowledgeable body and better able to counter the influence of the House On the other hand a very large Senate would soon lose its distinctive membership and purpose and actually decrease its ability to check the lower house or to allow senators to take personal responsibility for their actions Given these considerations delegates had a limited choice regarding the number of senators During the convention they briefly discussed the advantages of two seats versus three Gouverneur Morris stated that three senators per state were necessary to form an acceptable quorum while other delegates thought a third senator would be too costly On July 23 delegates filled in the blank in the proposal offered by Morris and Rufus King  dquo hat the representation in the second branch consist of    members from each State who shall vote per capita rdquo Only Pennsylvania voted in favor of three senators When the question turned to two Maryland alone voted against the measure not because of the number but because Martin disagreed with per capita voting which gave each senator rather than each state one vote In its final form the clause in the Constitution is deceptively simple  dquo he Senate shall be composed of two senators from each state dquo appears to be a single provision the designated number of senators per state Delegates agreed to this number however only after they had considered a larger matter legislative representation While representation proved to be the most controversial issue in the convention delegates determined the number of senators quickly and with little dispute  bsp Term Length The Senate of the United States shall be composed of two Senators from each State chosen by the Legislature thereof for six Years    Constitution Article I section 3 clause 1 The six ear Senate term represented a compromise between those constitutional framers who wanted a strong independent Senate and those who feared the possible tyranny of an aristocratic upper house insulated from popular opinion Although the six ear term was not utilized in Parliament Congress under the Articles of Confederation  or the states squo upper houses these institutions gave the participants at the Constitutional Convention some insight into the impact of term lengths on legislative bodies While few delegates to the 1787 convention wanted to emulate the House of Lords squo lifelong terms or the Articles of Confederation squo  annual appointment of legislators subject to recall the framers squo reaction against these extremes helped formulate their arguments for and against long terms in the Senate Convention delegates seeking information about more moderate term lengths turned to the state constitutions Although the majority of states set one ear terms for both legislative bodies five state constitutions established longer terms for upper house members South Carolina squo  senators received two ear terms In Delaware the senate had three ear terms with one hird of the senate squo  nine members up for reelection each year New York and Virginia implemented a similar class system but with four ear terms instead of three Only Maryland squo  aristocratic senate featured five ear terms making this legislative body the focus of the convention squo  Senate term debates Framers either praised Maryland squo  long terms for checking lower house democracy or feared them for the same reason while some members of the convention believed even five ear terms were too short to counteract the dangerous notions expected to emerge from the House of Representatives In June James Madison Edmund Randolph and other convention delegates cited Maryland squo  experiences when they argued for long Senate terms According to Madison Maryland squo  senate had never  dquo reated just suspicions of danger rdquo Far from being the more powerful branch the senate had actually yielded too much at times to Maryland squo  House of Delegates Unless the Senate obtained sufficient stability Madison expected a similar situation under the new Constitution He suggested terms of seven years or more to counter the influence of the democratic House of Representatives Randolph believed that the primary object of an upper house was to control the more numerous lower house He noted that Maryland squo  senate had followed this principle but had been  dquo carcely able to stem the popular torrent rdquo even ear terms then had a greater chance of checking the House than terms of five years or fewer On June 13 the convention squo  Committee of the Whole reported an amended version of Madison squo  Virginia Plan  The revised document now designated seven ear Senate terms a provisional length immediately criticized by some of the framers For Alexander Hamilton only lifelong terms could check the  dquo mazing violence  mp turbulence of the democratic spirit rdquo ther delegates preferred four ear terms while Madison began advocating a new nine ear three lass plan On June 26 the majority of delegations voted against the nine ear plan then adopted the six ear Senate term by a vote of 7 to 4 During the debate on the Constitution squo  ratification Madison became a strong supporter of six ear terms In the Federalist papers  he argued that Maryland squo  experiment with five ear terms proved that slightly longer terms posed no danger to bicameral legislatures In fact he expected the six ear terms to have a stabilizing effect on the new national government Long terms would control turnover in the legislature allow senators to take responsibility for measures over time and make senators largely independent of public opinion Senate Classes Immediately after they shall be assembled in Consequence of the first Election they shall be divided as equally as may be into three Classes  rticle I section 3 clause 2 Every two years one hird of the Senate squo  members must be reelected or vacate their seats at the end of their terms Constitutional framers based this three lass system on precedents established by state governments Delaware squo  senate and Pennsylvania squo  unicameral council were divided into three classes on a one ear election rotation while upper houses in Virginia and New York had four classes and yearly elections  bsp At the 1787 Constitutional Convention  delegates linked the Senate class measure to the debate on term lengths On June 25 Nathaniel Gorham suggested a four ear Senate term with one ourth of the senators elected each year Edmund Randolph supported staggered rotation in the Senate but wanted a seven ear term  dquo o go out in fixt proportion rdquo  bsp ugh Williamson countered that six ear terms were more easily divisible into equal election cycles than seven ear terms The following day Gorham called for a six ear term  dquo ne third of the members to go out every second year rdquo Delegates considered a nine ear term then passed the six ear three lass Senate clause by a vote of 7 to 4 Constitutional commentator Joseph Story  779 845 explained the reasoning behind the Senate squo  class system Framers hoped biennial elections would bring stability to the Senate and in turn to other branches of the new government By gradually changing members class rotations would prevent senators from permanently combining for  dquo inister purposes rdquo protect the Senate from a rapid turnover in ideas and encourage senators to deliberate measures over time Most important as the federal government squo  only continuing body the Senate could provide leadership after major elections and during other periods of national uncertainty At the start of the first session of Congress in 1789 the senators were divided into the three classes by lot with same tate senators assigned to separate groups The first class squo term expired in two years the second in four years and the third in six years Subsequent elections to all classes were for the full six ear Senate term Qualifications No Person shall be a Senator who shall not have attained to the Age of thirty Years and been nine Years a Citizen of the United States and who shall not when elected be an Inhabitant of that State for which he shall be chosen    Constitution Article I section 3 clause 3 Delegates to the 1787 Constitutional Convention supported establishing membership limitations for House and Senate members Influenced by British and state precedents they set age citizenship and inhabitancy qualifications for senators but voted against proposed religion and property requirements  bsp Age The constitutional framers debated the minimum age for representatives before they considered the same qualification for senators Although Delegate James Wilson stated that  dquo here was no more reason for incapacitating youth than age where the requisite qualifications were found rdquo other delegates were in favor of age restrictions They were familiar with England squo  law requiring members of Parliament to be twenty ne or older and they lived in states which either barred legislators under the ages of twenty ne or twenty ive from the upper chambers As introduced in May 1787 James Madison squo  Virginia Plan left Senate age restrictions to the delegates to decide only stating that members of the second branch must  dquo e of the age of    at least rdquo Without debating the subject further delegates voted in favor of filling the blank with thirty and passed the clause unanimously on June 25 three days after designating twenty ive as the minimum age for representatives In The Federalist  No 62  Madison justified the higher age requirement for senators By its deliberative nature the  dquo enatorial trust rdquo called for a  dquo reater extent of information and stability of character rdquo han would be needed in the more democratic House of Representatives Citizenship Under English law no person  dquo orn out of the kingdoms of England cotland or Ireland dquo could be a member of either house of Parliament While some delegates may have admired the  dquo trictness dquo of this policy no framers advocated a blanket ban on foreign orn legislators Instead they debated the length of time members of Congress should be citizens before taking office The states squo residency qualifications offered moderate guidelines in this regard New Hampshire squo  state senators needed to be residents for at least seven years prior to election In other states upper house members fulfilled a five three or one ear requirement while state representatives completed a residency period of one to three years The Virginia Plan made no mention of citizenship when Edmund Randolph introduced it to the convention in May Two months later the Committee of Detail reported a draft of the Constitution Article V section 3 included a four ear citizenship requirement for senators On August 9 Gouverneur Morris moved to replace the four ear clause with a fourteen ear minimum Later that day delegates voted against citizenship requirements of fourteen thirteen and ten years before passing the nine ear provision making the Senate requirement two years longer than that for the House of Representatives At the convention delegates viewed the nine ear citizenship qualification as a compromise  dquo etween a total exclusion of adopted citizens dquo and an  dquo ndiscriminate and hasty admission of them rdquo hile they were concerned that the Senate especially might be subject to foreign influence they did not wish to close the institution to naturalized citizens of merit Two foreign orn framers expressed these opposing considerations According to Pierce Butler recent arrivals were dangerously attached to their countries of origin a particular concern for senators whose role would include review of foreign treaties From his own experience he believed that naturalized citizens would need sufficient time to learn and appreciate American laws and customs before they could serve in government For James Wilson however lengthy citizenship requirements  dquo iscouraged and mortified dquo everyone they excluded He agreed with Benjamin Franklin that a strict policy would hinder positive immigration and offend those Europeans who had supported the Revolutionary War On August 13 Wilson moved to reduce the Senate qualification by two years Delegates rejected his motion and confirmed the nine ear requirement by an 8 to 3 vote Inhabitancy Although England repealed Parliament squo  residency law in 1774 no delegates spoke against a residency requirement for members of Congress The qualification first came under consideration on August 6 when the Committee of Detail reported its draft of the Constitution Article 5 section 3 stated  dquo very member of the Senate shall be    at the time of his election a resident of the state from which he shall be chosen rdquo On August 8 Roger Sherman moved to strike the word  dquo esident dquo from the House version of the clause and insert in its place  dquo nhabitant rdquo a term he considered to be  dquo ess liable to misconstruction rdquo Madison seconded the motion noting that  dquo esident dquo might exclude people occasionally absent on public or private business Delegates agreed to the term  dquo nhabitant rdquo and voted against adding a time period to the requirement The following day they amended the Senate qualification to include the word  dquo nhabitant rdquo prior to passing the clause by unanimous consent President of the Senate The Vice President of the United States shall be President of the Senate but shall have no Vote unless they be equally divided    Constitution Article I section 3 clause 4 On September 4 1787 the term  dquo ice president rdquo appeared for the first time at the Constitutional Convention  The Committee of Unfinished Portions reported a method of electing the president and vice president and recommended that the vice president be the  dquo x fficio President of the Senate rdquo Although delegates passed the latter measure three days later few understood the extent of the vice president squo  duties not having a similar position in their own states New York squo  constitution however contained the clear precedent  dquo he lieutenant overnor shall by virtue of his office be president of the senate and upon an equal division have a casting voice in their decisions but not vote on any other occasion rdquo ew York then is aptly credited for the establishment of the vice president squo  office in both its executive and senatorial functions Convention delegates first considered the selection of the Senate squo  presiding officer after the Committee of Detail presented a draft of the Constitution on August 6 Article III section 4 stated  dquo he Senate shall choose its own President rdquo while another article designated the president of the Senate as the executive squo  immediate successor Both provisions passed without dissent Later in the month however increasing support for a separation of powers motivated the Committee of Unfinished Portions to create the electoral college system rather than have the national legislature elect the president The committee also suggested that a vice president succeed the executive in the event of a vacancy in that position but would otherwise serve as the president of the Senate casting votes only to break a tie On September 7 Elbridge Gerry and George Mason spoke against the proposed measure believing that it conflicted with the goal to keep the executive and legislative departments separate and distinct Roger Sherman defended the clause  dquo f the vice resident were not to be President of the Senate he would be without employment and some member by being made President must be deprived of his vote rdquo Evidently most delegates agreed with Sherman squo  reasoning and they passed the measure by an 8 to 2 vote In The Federalist  No 68 New York delegate Alexander Hamilton explained the necessity of the vice president squo  Senate position To secure definitive resolutions the Senate squo  president must be able to cast tie reaking votes yet be denied a vote at all other times Therefore the Senate squo  presiding officer must not be a member of the Senate nor should a senator be next in line for the presidency since the president squo  successor should be chosen in the same manner as the president Other Senate Officers The Senate shall chuse their other Officers and also a President pro tempore in the Absence of the Vice President or when he shall exercise the Office of President of the United States  rticle 1 section 3 clause 5 Before Constitutional framers designated the vice president as the president of the Senate on September 7 1787 they granted senators the right to choose other Senate officers including those from outside the elected body  bsp he clause was not debated at the convention but simply assumed in the Committee of Detail squo  report to the Constitutional Convention on August 6 According to James Madison numerous precedents made the measure  dquo o obvious that it  as wholly unnecessary to vindicate it  dquo embers of Parliament had been selecting clerks of the house and sergeants at arms for hundreds of years and state legislatures appointed various administrative officers The Senate modeled its own offices of the secretary the sergeant at arms and the doorkeeper after positions established in the Continental Congress  Unlike the secretary and the sergeant at arms the president pro tempore is an elected member of the Senate chosen by the Senate to preside in the absence of the vice president The position resulted from the framers squo decision to make the vice president the president of the Senate but it originated in the state legislatures While other states provided stand ns for presiding officers New York specified the arrangement in its constitution whenever the lieutenant overnor  dquo hall be unable to attend as president of the senate the senators shall have power to elect one of their own members to the office of president of the senate which he shall exercise  ntil the lieutenant governor resumes his position in the chamber  dquo At the convention delegates first considered having an elected senator be the president of the Senate as shown in the Committee of Detail squo  report on August 6 However in September Roger Sherman observed that except in the case of a tie the presiding officer would be deprived of his vote Rather than disadvantage one state by elevating its senator to a non oting position framers made the vice president the president of the Senate As of September 10 they accepted the president pro tempore as the presiding officer squo  substitute to preside over the Senate or select another senator to preside during the absence of the vice president Senate Impeachment Trials The Senate shall have the sole Power to try all Impeachments    And no Person shall be convicted without the Concurrence of two thirds of the Members present  rticle I section 3 clause 6 Early in the 1787 Constitutional Convention  most delegates agreed that the inclusion of an impeachment provision would help to hold national officers accountable for their actions The Senate squo  role in impeachment trials however developed after months of consideration behind the closed doors of committee rooms Based on those of the British Parliament and the state constitutions the Senate impeachment provision gave senators the responsibility for trying impeached officials including the president of the United States Throughout the summer of 1787 committee members reported impeachment plans to the full convention The preliminary resolutions were considered by the Committee of the Whole and returned to selected delegates for further revision First submitted on May 29 James Madison squo  Virginia Plan proposed a supreme tribunal to hear and determine cases including among other concerns the  dquo mpeachments of any National officers  dquo n June 13 the Committee of the Whole amended the plan squo  proposition Section nine of the committee squo  report stated that the president could be  dquo emovable on impeachment of malpractices or neglect of duty  dquo he revised measure did not specify the procedures for trying the national executive In June and July the framers debated the merits of involving Congress in the impeachment process  bsp oger Sherman  dquo ontended that the National Legislature should have the power to remove the Executive at pleasure  dquo eorge Mason objected to Sherman squo  plan claiming that the president would become the  dquo reature of the Legislature  dquo ohn Dickinson countered with an unsuccessful motion to make the executive  dquo emovable by National Legislature at request of majority of State Legislatures rdquo On August 6 the Committee of Detail reported that the House of Representatives  dquo hall have the sole power of impeachment  dquo nd the executive  dquo hall be removed from his office by conviction in the supreme Court of treason bribery or corruption  dquo wo weeks later the committee added that  dquo he judges of the supreme court be triable by the senate on impeachment by the house of representatives rdquo The constitutional plan then went for review to the Committee of Eleven consisting of one member from every state represented at the convention Presented to the full convention on September 4 the Committee of Eleven squo  report stated  dquo he Senate of the U  shall have power to try all impeachments  y the House of Representatives  but no person shall be convicted without the concurrence of two thirds of the members present  dquo he framers debated the clause on September 8 Arguing that the executive would become dependent on the legislature Madison opposed Senate impeachment trials He moved to strike out the words  dquo y the Senate dquo after the word  dquo onviction rdquo but the resolution was rejected Later that day the delegates agreed to Gouverneur Morris squo addition  dquo nd every member shall be on oath dquo before they passed the final measure by an 8 to 2 vote In The Federalist No 65  Alexander Hamilton explained the Committee of Eleven squo  rationale for placing impeachment trials in the Senate no other institution would be sufficiently dignified or independent to handle the proceedings Furthermore the British Parliament and the state constitutions provided similar models for legislative impeachments  bsp n England impeachments were instituted by the House of Commons and tried by the House of Lords Penalties for conviction ranged from fines to jail banishment or death Following the Declaration of Independence the states based their constitutions squo impeachment clauses on their colonial charters which limited both the punishment and the conditions for impeachment  bsp Madison in The Federalist  No 47 referred to the impeachment provisions in the New York New Jersey and Massachusetts state constitutions In New York members of the legislature and the judiciary served on a court of impeachment while in New Jersey select officers could be dismissed by the upper house on impeachment by the lower house The clearest antecedent to the U  impeachment clause however is found in Massachusetts squo 1780 constitution  bsp ection 2 Article VIII states  dquo he senate shall be a court with full authority to hear and determine all impeachments made by the house of representatives against any officer or officers of the commonwealth for misconduct and maladministration of their offices rdquo Treaties He shall have Powers by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate to make Treaties provided two thirds of the Senators present concur        Constitution Article II section 2 clause 2 As they debated the controversial treaty aking clause the delegates to the 1787 Constitutional Convention considered but did not follow in whole those precedents with which they were most familiar In Great Britain treaties were made by the king and in certain cases had to be approved by a majority vote in Parliament The Continental Congress which had no executive branch dispatched agents to negotiate treaties The treaties only went into effect after two hirds  ine out of thirteen of the states approved the documents This inefficient process was further complicated by the states squo ability to enter into their own treaties While the delegates agreed that the states could not continue to make treaties with foreign powers they disagreed over the manner in which the United States should negotiate draft and ratify international pacts On August 6 the convention squo  Committee of Detail reported a preliminary Constitution to the full convention Article IX section 1 stated  dquo he Senate of the United States shall have power to make treaties and to appoint Ambassadors and Judges of the Supreme Court  dquo hroughout August and into the month of September the delegates debated treaty aking as a separate issue from the rest of the clause Several delegates opposed granting the Senate sole control over treaty aking While some wanted the executive to have that responsibility others advocated involving the entire legislature in the process Small tate delegates however preferred the Committee of Detail squo  treaty clause because it gave each state an equal say in the adoption or rejection of treaties  bsp On September 4 the Committee of Eleven reported a treaty clause that appeased many of the delegates  dquo he President by and with the advice and Consent of the Senate shall have power to make Treaties rdquo After further debate the delegates unanimously approved the clause on September 7 The clause however was taken up again this time to add to it the words  dquo ut no treaty shall be made without the consent of two thirds of the members present  dquo Shortly thereafter the convention adopted James Madison squo  addition  dquo xcept in treaties of peace rdquo which would be ratified by a simple majority vote The next day the delegates struck out the peace treaty exception and considered dropping the Senate super majority as well After two delegates cited the Continental Congress squo  dquo wo hirds of the states dquo example however they voted to keep the two hirds requirement  bsp Although adopted by the convention the treaty clause continued to stir debate in the period before the Constitution squo  ratification As one of the clause squo  strongest proponents Alexander Hamilton defended the provision in The Federalist No 75  Remarkably given the delegates squo extreme dissension over treaty aking he wrote the clause  dquo s one of the best digested and unexceptionable parts of the plan rdquo Nominations  he president shall nominate and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate shall appoint Ambassadors other public Ministers and Consuls Judges of the supreme Court and all other Officers of the United States        Constitution Article II section 2 clause 2 Debated over the course of several weeks the Constitution squo  nomination clause split the delegates into two factions those who wanted the executive to have the sole power of appointment and those who wanted the national legislature and more specifically the Senate to have that responsibility The latter faction followed precedents established by the Articles of Confederation and most of the state constitutions These documents granted the Continental Congress and the state legislatures the power to make appointments The Massachusetts constitution provided an alternative model however For over one hundred years assachusetts had divided the appointment responsibilities between its governor who made the nominations and its legislative council which confirmed the appointments Rather than adopt the Massachusetts model immediately the convention delegates initially granted the president the power to appoint the officers of the executive branch and given that judges squo life ong terms would extend past the authority of any one president the Senate would appoint the members of the judiciary Framers in favor of a strong executive however argued that Senate appointments would lead to government by a  dquo abal dquo swayed by the interests of constituents Other delegates fearful of monarchies wanted to remove the president entirely from the appointment process On September 4 the Committee of Eleven reported an amended appointment clause nanimously adopted on September 7 the clause based on the Massachusetts model provided that the president shall nominate and with the advice and consent of the Senate appoint the officers of the
