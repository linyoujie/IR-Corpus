was alan turing alan turing was an english mathematician and pioneer of theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence during ww2 he was instrumental in breaking the german enigma code leading to allied victory over nazi germany what happened in alan turing squo  early years alan turing was born on 23 june 1912 in maida vale london his intelligence was clear from his school days at the age of 9 his headmistress from st michael  primary school in hastings reported  squo  have had clever boys and hard orking boys but alan is a genius squo  turing moved to hazelhurst preparatory school in 1922 where he became interested in chess spending hours working out complex chess problems on his own at the age of 13 he attended sherborne school in dorset although his maths teacher mr randolph declared him a  squo enius squo  this counted little in a school that placed its emphasis on humanities and classics teachers would often get annoyed with him for his high marks in exams despite him paying little attention during lessons what was alan turing squo  relationship with christopher morcom towards the end of his time at sherborne turing formed a close relationship with another student christopher morcom who shared his intellectual curiosity and inspired alan squo  future endeavours he has been described as turing squo   squo irst love squo  however their relationship was cut short by morcom  death in 1930 from tuberculosis turing coped with his grief by devoting his energy to scientific study in an attempt to fulfil his friend  potential what happened in alan turing squo  university years turing attended king  college university of cambridge in 1931 to study mathematics in this academic environment he settled in much better and his years there were highly successful in both his work and social life turing took up rowing and became an excellent long distance runner he also became involved in the peace movement joining the anti ar council which called for chemicals and munitions workers to strike if war was declared amid the rise of hitler turing graduated in 1934 with a first lass honours degree and as a result of his dissertation was elected a fellow of king  college at the age of 22 in 1936 turing went on to study mathematics at princeton university new jersey obtaining his ph  in 1938 during his time here he developed the notion of a  squo niversal computing machine squo which could solve complex calculations this would become known as the turing machine which foreshadowed the digital computer he also studied cryptology the study of codes and cyphers which can be used to send secret messages and built three out of four stages of an electro echanical binary multiplier what did alan turing do at bletchley park in 1939 turing was asked to join the government codes and cypher school a british code reaking organisation  ow gchq  which was moved to bletchley park when war was declared on 3 september turing squo  most notable achievement at bletchley was cracking the  squo nigma squo code  the enigma was an enciphering machine used by the german armed forces to send messages securely together with fellow code reaker gordon welchman turing developed the bombe  a machine based on an earlier polish design which from late 1940 was decoding all messages sent by the enigma machines next turing turned his attentions to the more complex german naval signals and together with his  squo hut 8  squo team at bletchley succeeded in decrypting these as well in 1941 contributing to allied victory in the battle of the atlantic in july 1942 turing developed a complex code reaking technique he named  squo turingery  squo for use against the lorenz cipher messages produced by the germans new geheimschreiber  ecret writer machine turing also developed a secure speech system which he named delilah  the system which encoded and decoded voice communications was intended to be used in a similar way to a telephone scrambler he demonstrated its mechanisms on one of churchill  speeches but the machine was never commissioned for use in the war effort what did turing do after his work at bletchley park in 1945 turing was awarded an obe for his services to the country and in 1949 was made deputy director of the computing laboratory at the university of manchester turing first addressed the issue of artificial intelligence  i in his famous paper computing machinery and intelligence  950  in it he devised what he called the  mitation game  ow called the  squo uring test squo   dash a method to determine whether a machine showing behaviour can truly be called  squo ntelligent squo  the test has significantly influenced research on ai why was alan turing convicted in 1952 turing reported a burglary to the police where it emerged that the perpetrator arnold murray was in a sexual relationship with him as a result of anti omosexuality laws in the uk in the 1950s alan was charged with gross indecency  verturned in 2013  he avoided prison by accepting chemical castration which eventually left him impotent turing  security clearance was also removed and he was barred from continuing his work with cryptography at the gchq how did alan turing die on 7 june 1954 turing was found dead from cyanide poisoning an inquest ruled that it was suicide although this has been contested more recently with turing expert prof jack copeland attributing his death to the accidental inhalation of cyanide fumes during an experiment what was alan turing  legacy the extent of alan turing squo  work did not fully come to life until after his death his impact on computer science is commemorated in the annual  squo uring award squo  dash the highest accolade in the industry meanwhile his code reaking operations at bletchley park are credited with shortening the war by as much as two years and resulting in allied victory  dash saving countless lives in the process in 2015 a new national centre for research in data science and ai the alan turing institute  was created in his name facts about alan turing turing squo  first day of sherborne school coincided with the 1926 general strike but he was so determined to make it in that he cycled 60 miles turing was often spotted running along the riverside paths between cambridge and ely this is commemorated by an annual race the turing relay which takes place along those tracks alan turing is credited with designing the first computer chess program in 1950 named turochamp turing was known for his eccentricity at bletchley park his colleagues called him  rof and his treatise on the enigma was known as  he prof  book  further information about the life of alan turing can be found here via the oxford dictionary of national
