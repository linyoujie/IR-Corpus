 history of computers history of computers this chapter is a brief summary of the history of computers it is supplemented by the two pbs documentaries video tapes  nventing the future nd  he paperback computer  thechapter highlights some of the advances to look for in the documentaries in particular when viewing the movies you should look for two things the progression in hardware representation of a bit of data vacuum tubes  950s  one bit on the size of a thumb transistors  950s and 1960s  one bit on the size of a fingernail integrated circuits  960s and 70s  thousands of bits on the size of a hand silicon computer chips  970s and on  millions of bits on the size of a finger nail the progression of the ease of use of computers almost impossible to use except by very patient geniuses  950s  programmable by highly trained people only  960s and 1970s  useable by just about anyone  980s and on  to see how computers got smaller cheaper and easier to use first computers eniac computer the first substantial computer was the giant eniac machine by john w mauchly and j prespereckert at the university of pennsylvania eniac  lectrical numericalintegrator and calculator used a word of 10 decimal digits instead of binaryones like previous automated calculators omputers eniac was also the firstmachine to use more than 2 00 vacuum tubes using nearly 18 00 vacuum tubes torage of all those vacuum tubes and the machinery required to keep the cooltook up over 167 square meters  800 square feet of floor space nonetheless t had punched ard input and output and arithmetically had 1 multiplier 1divider quare rooter and 20 adders employing decimal  ing counters  whichserved as adders and also as quick ccess   002 seconds read rite registerstorage the executable instructions composing a program were embodied in the separateunits of eniac which were plugged together to form a route through themachine for the flow of computations these connections had to be redone foreach different problem together with presetting function tables and switches his  ire our wn instruction technique was inconvenient and only withsome license could eniac be considered programmable it was however fficient in handling the particular programs for which it had been designed niac is generally acknowledged to be the first successful high peedelectronic digital computer  dc and was productively used from 1946 to 1955  controversy developed in 1971 however over the patentability of eniac basic digital concepts the claim being made that another u  physicist johnv atanasoff had already used the same ideas in a simpler vacuum ube devicehe built in the 1930s while at iowa state college in 1973 the court found infavor of the company using atanasoff claim and atanasoff received theacclaim he rightly deserved progression of hardware in the 1950  two devices would be invented that would improve the computerfield and set in motion the beginning of the computer revolution the first of thesetwo devices was the transistor invented in 1947 by william shockley johnbardeen and walter brattain of bell labs the transistor was fated to oustthe days of vacuum tubes in computers radios and other electronics vaccum tubes the vacuum tube used up to this time in almost all the computers andcalculating machines had been invented by american physicist lee de forest in1906 the vacuum tube which is about the size of a human thumb worked by using large amounts of electricity to heat afilament inside the tube until it was cherry red one result of heating thisfilament up was the release of electrons into the tube which could becontrolled by other elements within the tube de forest  original device wasa triode which could control the flow of electrons to a positively chargedplate inside the tube a zero could then be represented by the absence of anelectron current to the plate the presence of a small but detectable currentto the plate represented a one transistors vacuum tubes were highly inefficient required a great deal of space andneeded to be replaced often computers of the 1940s and 50s had 18 00 tubes in themand housing all these tubes and cooling the rooms from the heat produced by18 00 tubes was not cheap the transistor promised to solve all of theseproblems and it did so transistors however had their problems too themain problem was that transistors like other electronic components needed tobe soldered together as a result the more complex the circuits became themore complicated and numerous the connections between the individualtransistors and the likelihood of faulty wiring increased in 1958 this problem too was solved by jack st clair kilby of texasinstruments he manufactured the first integrated circuit or chip a chip isreally a collection of tiny transistors which are connected together when thetransistor is manufactured thus the need for soldering together largenumbers of transistors was practically nullified now only connections wereneeded to other electronic components in addition to saving space the speedof the machine was now increased since there was a diminished distance thatthe electrons had to follow circuit board silicon chip mainframes to pcs the 1960s saw large mainframe computers become much more common in large industries and with the us military and space program ibm became the unquestioned market leader in selling these large expensive error rone nd very hard to use machines a veritable explosion of personalcomputers occurred in the early 1970s starting with steve jobs and steve wozniak exhibiting thefirst apple ii at the first west coast computer faire in san francisco theapple ii boasted built n basic programming language color graphics and a 4100 character memoryfor only  298 programs and data could be stored on an everyday audio assette recorder before the end of the fair wozniak and jobs had secured300 orders for the apple ii and from there apple just took off also introduced in 1977 was the trs 0 this was a home computer manufactured bytandy radio shack in its second incarnation the trs 0 model ii camecomplete with a 64 00 character memory and a disk drive to store programs anddata on at this time only apple and trs had machines with disk drives ith the introduction of the disk drive personal computer applications tookoff as a floppy disk was a most convenient publishing medium for distributionof software ibm which up to this time had been producing mainframes and minicomputers formedium to large ized businesses decided that it had to get into the act andstarted working on the acorn which would later be called the ibm pc the pcwas the first computer designed for the home market which would featuremodular design so that pieces could easily be added to the architecture mostof the components surprisingly came from outside of ibm since building itwith ibm parts would have cost too much for the home computer market when itwas introduced the pc came with a 16 00 character memory keyboard from anibm electric typewriter and a connection for tape cassette player for 265 by 1984 apple and ibm had come out with new models apple released the firstgeneration macintosh which was the first computer to come with a graphicaluser interface ui and a mouse the gui made the machine much moreattractive to home computer users because it was easy to use sales of themacintosh soared like nothing ever seen before ibm was hot on apple  tailand released the 286 t which with applications like lotus 1   aspreadsheet and microsoft word quickly became the favourite of businessconcerns that brings us up to about ten years ago now people have their own personalgraphics workstations and powerful home computers the average computera person might have in their home is more powerful by several orders ofmagnitude than a machine like eniac the computer revolution has beenthe fastest growing technology in man  history timeline if you would like more
