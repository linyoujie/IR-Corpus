confrontation outbreak of world war ii  939 in late august 1939 hitler and soviet leader joseph stalin signed the german oviet nonaggression pact  which incited a frenzy of worry in london and paris hitler had long planned an invasion of poland a nation to which great britain and france had guaranteed military support if it was attacked by germany the pact with stalin meant that hitler would not face a war on two fronts once he invaded poland and would have soviet assistance in conquering and dividing the nation itself on september 1 1939 hitler invaded poland from the west two days later france and britain declared war on germany beginning world war ii on september 17 soviet troops invaded poland from the east under attack from both sides poland fell quickly and by early 1940 germany and the soviet union had divided control over the nation according to a secret protocol appended to the nonaggression pact stalin x2019  forces then moved to occupy the baltic states  stonia latvia and lithuania and defeated a resistant finland in the russo inish war during the six months following the invasion of poland the lack of action on the part of germany and the allies in the west led to

defensive barrier in fact the germans broke through the line with their tanks and planes and continued to the rear rendering it useless the british expeditionary force  ef was evacuated by sea from dunkirk in late may while in the south french forces mounted a doomed resistance with france on the verge of collapse benito mussolini of italy put his pact of steel with hitler into action and italy declared war against france and britain on june 10 on june 14 german forces entered paris a new government formed by marshal philippe petain  rance x2019  hero of world war i requested an armistice two nights later france was subsequently divided into two zones one under german military occupation and the other under petain x2019  government installed at vichy france hitler now turned his attention to britain which had the defensive advantage of being separated from the continent by the english channel to pave the way for an amphibious invasion  ubbed operation sea lion  german planes bombed britain extensively throughout the summer of 1940 including night raids on london and other industrial centers that caused heavy civilian casualties and damage the royal air force  af
