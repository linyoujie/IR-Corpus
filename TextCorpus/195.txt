diabolical  x201C inal Solution  201D now known as the Holocaust Leading up to World War II The devastation of the Great War  s World War I was known at the time had greatly destabilized Europe and in many respects World War II grew out of issues left unresolved by that earlier conflict In particular political and economic instability in Germany and lingering resentment over the harsh terms imposed by the Versailles Treaty fueled the rise to power of Adolf Hitler and his National Socialist  azi Party Did you know As early as 1923 in his memoir and propaganda tract  uot ein Kampf uot  y Struggle  Adolf Hitler had predicted a general European war that would result in  uot he extermination of the Jewish race in Germany quot After becoming Reich Chancellor in 1933 Hitler swiftly consolidated power anointing himself F xFC rer  upreme leader in 1934 Obsessed with the idea of the superiority of the  x201C ure x201D German race which he called  x201C ryan  201D Hitler believed that war was the only way to gain the necessary  x201C ebensraum  201D or living space for that race to expand In the mid 930s he began the rearmament of Germany secretly and in violation of the Versailles Treaty After signing alliances with Italy and Japan against the Soviet Union  Hitler sent troops to occupy Austria in 1938 and the following year annexed Czechoslovakia Hitler x2019  open aggression went unchecked as the United States and Soviet Union were concentrated on internal politics at the time and neither France nor Britain  he two other nations most devastated by the Great War were eager for confrontation Outbreak of World War II  939 In late August 1939 Hitler and Soviet leader Joseph Stalin signed the German oviet Nonaggression Pact  which incited a frenzy of worry in London and Paris Hitler had long planned an invasion of Poland a nation to which Great Britain and France had guaranteed military support if it was attacked by Germany The pact with Stalin meant that Hitler would not face a war on two fronts once he invaded Poland and would have Soviet assistance in conquering and dividing the nation itself On September 1 1939 Hitler invaded Poland from the west two days later France and Britain declared war on Germany beginning World War II On September 17 Soviet troops invaded Poland from the east Under attack from both sides Poland fell quickly and by early 1940 Germany and the Soviet Union had divided control over the nation according to a secret protocol appended to the Nonaggression Pact Stalin x2019  forces then moved to occupy the Baltic States  stonia Latvia and Lithuania and defeated a resistant Finland in the Russo inish War During the six months following the invasion of Poland the lack of action on the part of Germany and the Allies in the west led to talk in the news media of a  x201C hony war  201D At sea however the British and German navies faced off in heated battle and lethal German U oat submarines struck at merchant shipping bound for Britain sinking more than 100 vessels in the first four months of World War II World War II in the West  940 1 On April 9 1940 Germany simultaneously invaded Norway and occupied Denmark and the war began in earnest On May 10 German forces swept through Belgium and the Netherlands in what became known as  x201C litzkrieg  201D or lightning war Three days later Hitler x2019  troops crossed the Meuse River and struck French forces at Sedan located at the northern end of the Maginot Line  an elaborate chain of fortifications constructed after World War I and considered an impenetrable defensive barrier In fact the Germans broke through the line with their tanks and planes and continued to the rear rendering it useless The British Expeditionary Force  EF was evacuated by sea from Dunkirk in late May while in the south French forces mounted a doomed resistance With France on the verge of collapse Benito Mussolini of Italy put his Pact of Steel with Hitler into action and Italy declared war against France and Britain on June 10 On June 14 German forces entered Paris a new government formed by Marshal Philippe Petain  rance x2019  hero of World War I requested an armistice two nights later France was subsequently divided into two zones one under German military occupation and the other under Petain x2019  government installed at Vichy France Hitler now turned his attention to Britain which had the defensive advantage of being separated from the Continent by the English Channel To pave the way for an amphibious invasion  ubbed Operation Sea Lion  German planes bombed Britain extensively throughout the summer of 1940 including night raids on London and other industrial centers that caused heavy civilian casualties and damage The Royal Air Force  AF eventually defeated the Luftwaffe  erman Air Force in the Battle of Britain  and Hitler postponed his plans to invade With Britain x2019  defensive resources pushed to the limit Prime Minister Winston Churchill began receiving crucial aid from the U  under the Lend ease Act  passed by Congress in early 1941 Operation Barbarossa  941 2 By early 1941 Hungary Romania and Bulgaria had joined the Axis and German troops overran Yugoslavia and Greece that April Hitler x2019  conquest of the Balkans was a precursor for his real objective an invasion of the Soviet Union whose vast territory would give the German master race the  x201C ebensraum x201D it needed The other half of Hitler x2019  strategy was the extermination of the Jews from throughout German ccupied Europe Plans for the  x201C inal Solution x201D were introduced around the time of the Soviet offensive and over the next three years more than 4 million Jews would perish in the death camps established in occupied Poland On June 22 1941 Hitler ordered the invasion of the Soviet Union codenamed Operation Barbarossa  Though Soviet tanks and aircraft greatly outnumbered the Germans x2019  their air technology was largely obsolete and the impact of the surprise invasion helped Germans get within 200 miles of Moscow by mid uly Arguments between Hitler and his commanders delayed the next German advance until October when it was stalled by a Soviet counteroffensive and the onset of harsh winter weather World War II in the Pacific  941 3 With Britain facing Germany in Europe the United States was the only nation capable of combating Japanese aggression which by late 1941 included an expansion of its ongoing war with China and the seizure of European colonial holdings in the Far East On December 7 1941 360 Japanese aircraft attacked the major U  naval base at Pearl Harbor in Hawaii  taking the Americans completely by surprise and claiming the lives of more than 2 00 troops The attack on Pearl Harbor served to unify American public opinion in favor of entering World War II and on December 8 Congress declared war on Japan with only one dissenting vote Germany and the other Axis Powers promptly declared war on the United States After a long string of Japanese victories the U  Pacific Fleet won the Battle of Midway in June 1942 which proved to be a turning point in the war On Guadalcanal one of the southern Solomon Islands the Allies also had success against Japanese forces in a series of battles from August 1942 to February 1943 helping turn the tide further in the Pacific In mid 943 Allied naval forces began an aggressive counterattack against Japan involving a series of amphibious assaults on key Japanese eld islands in the Pacific This  x201C sland opping x201D strategy proved successful and Allied forces moved closer to their ultimate goal of invading the Japanese homeland Toward Allied Victory in World War II  943 5 In North Africa  British and American forces had defeated the Italians and Germans by 1943 An Allied invasion of Sicily and Italy followed and Mussolini x2019  government fell in July 1943 though Allied fighting against the Germans in Italy would continue until 1945 On World War II x2019  Eastern Front a Soviet counteroffensive launched in November 1942 ended the bloody Battle of Stalingrad  which had seen some of the fiercest combat of the

x201C  ay x201D  x2013 he Allies began a massive invasion of Europe landing 156 00 British Canadian and American soldiers on the beaches of Normandy France In response Hitler poured all the remaining
