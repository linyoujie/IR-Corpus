updated september 13 2019 7 6 am ist share this on wednesday newton and einstein were the top trends in india and thousands of citizens were looking up who discovered gravity no trends were not the result of a sudden inquisitive turn of the indian intellect neither did they reflect the scientific temper of the country the trends in fact were the result of certain statements made by union railway minister piyush goyal during an event speaking at a board of trade meeting goyal who is a former finance minister derided math and also logic when he said  don  get into the calculations that you see on television  goyal is heard saying in the viral video  f you look at a 5 trillion economy country will have to grow at 12 percent today its growing at 6   don  get into those maths  he went ahead to add that maths never helped einstein discover gravity well to be fair he was right math did not help einstein discover gravity isaac newton maybe since it was he who established the laws of gravity
