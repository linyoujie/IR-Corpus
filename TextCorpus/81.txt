january 19 2019 a puzzle about our solar system  8212 how long is a day on saturn  8212 has kept astronomers up at night for years this figure was hard to calculate the gas giant has no solid surface so there are no landmarks to track as the planet rotates and a magnetic field makes the rate of rotation hard to see what to do now nasa scientists have used data from the cassini spacecraft to pin down an answer and solve the puzzle a day on saturn is ten hours 33 minutes and 38 seconds long the new day length of 10 3 8 is somewhat shorter than previous estimates such as the 10 9 2 estimation from 1981 based on magnetic field data from voyager  an image of saturn captured by nasa 8217  cassini spacecraft in 2016 the rings of saturn have been used to work out the length of a day on the planet nasa pl altech pace science institute the new figure was calculated by looking at saturn 8217  rings about which cassini gathered lots of detailed data during its mission from launch in 1997 to its eventual destruction in the planet 8217  atmosphere in 2017 during its orbit of saturn from 2004 onward the craft collected high resolution images of the planet and data on its icy rocky rings this data was then used by graduate student christopher mankovich to study wave patterns within the rings mankovich found that the rings acted as a kind of seismometer responding to vibrations that occurred within the planet when the inside of the planet vibrates and earthquakes occur the vibration frequencies cause variations in the planet 8217  gravitational field and these variations are transmitted to the rings  8220 articles throughout the rings can 't help but feel these oscillations in the gravity field  221 mankovich explained in a statement   8220 t specific locations in the rings these oscillations catch ring particles at just the right time in their orbits to gradually build up energy and that energy gets carried away as an observable wave  221 this means that scientists can now track the movements of the planet 8217  interior and from that tracking they can see the planet 8217  rotation this is what allowed them to calculate the exact length of a day on saturn  8220 he researchers used waves in the rings to peer into saturn 8217  interior and out popped this long ought fundamental characteristic of the planet and it 8217  a really solid result  221 said cassini project scientist linda spilker in the same statement   8220 he rings held the answer  221 the paper is available at physics archive arxiv  editors recommendations revamped photo of  8216
