lining the sky over an observatory the earth  rotation slows down over time ©istockphoto om ukleerkedi modern timekeeping defines a day as the sum of 24 hours  dash but that is not quite correct the earth  rotation slows down over time so in terms of solar time  most days are a little longer than 24 hours universal time  t how long is today today is predicted to be 0 297 ms  illiseconds or 0 005297 seconds longer than 24 hours this is the time it takes earth to rotate 24 4 cm   0 in  as measured at the equator this means that today lasts 24 000001471 hours or 24 hours and 0 3 ms on

newsletter for leap second alerts why are the days getting longer the speed of the earth  rotation decreases over time but it also varies from day to day one of the main factors are the celestial bodies surrounding us for example the moon  gravitational pull causes tides and changes the earth  shape ultimately resulting in a lower rotational speed the distance between earth and moon changes constantly  which makes for daily variations in the speed our planet rotates around its own axis find day length for any date month  bsp  bsp day  bsp  bsp year date  bsp   based on mean solar day
