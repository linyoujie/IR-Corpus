and shakier claims 5 the first true americans if not columbus then who there are several theories as to who  8220 iscovered 8221 america some more substantiated than others we know for sure that vikings were in america centuries before columbus got there and there is also  isputed evidence that polynesian explorers also visited the continent before the spaniard technically nomadic asian tribes first discovered america over 15 00 years ago but let 8217  take it step by step the columbus expedition christopher columbus arrives in america by l prang  mp co  boston in 1492 columbus departed from the spanish city of palos de la frontera with three ships ironically spanish citizens were forced to contribute to the expedition against their will although that 8217  the smallest of columbus 8217 sins advertisement fast forward a few weeks and a lookout sailoron one of the ships saw land the captain of that ship  ot columbus confirmed the sighting and alerted columbus seizing the opportunity columbus later maintained that he himself had already seen a light hours beforehand  8212 because the first man to see new land would earn a lifetime pension from the spanish crown as we 8217 e already starting to see columbus wasn 8217  really the nicest or most honest person what island they found will remain a question for the ages what we do know is that columbus and his crew called it san salvador  the natives called it  guanahani  it was an island in the bahamas but we don 8217  really know which one they encountered peaceful natives who welcomed them peacefully columbus noticed the natives were wearing gold bracelets and necklaces so in true colonial fashion he took six of them as slaves without hesitation he wrote in his diary advertisement  8220 hey ought to make good and skilled servants for they repeat very quickly whatever we say to them i think they can very easily be made christians for they seem to have no religion if it pleases our lord i will take six of them to your highnesses when i depart in order that they may learn our language  221 columbus was also pleased to note that they didn 8217  seem to have any weapons or army  8220  could conquer the whole of them with 50 men and govern them as i pleased  221 what happened later is well nown history for the locals it was genocide for the europeans of the time it was a quick way to get incredibly rich and conquer new territories  8212 which they did to the best of their ability even conservative estimates suggest that in less than a decade the population of the island of hispaniola plunged from 500 00 to less than 100 00 either from sickness or conflict with colonists columbus became rich beyond his wildest dreams he was given 10 of all the removable assets of the newly discovered lands including gold silver pearls and precious stones and the trade therein was to be a crown monopoly under his control columbus paved the way for all of this 8230 is this really the person we want to celebrate for discovering america after all other explorers visited america centuries before him american vikings viking ships found america one thousand years ago image credits carolin w sure columbus made america known to the europeans who ultimately conquered it but he didn 8217  discover  it by any means leif erikson the son of erik the red was a norse explorer from iceland  8212 a viking erik the red founded the first norse settlement in greenland discovery and expansion ran through their blood as leif went on to travel much farther to america leif and his crew traveled from greenland to norway in 999 ad where he converted to christianity not long after that he sailed the atlantic according to the  sagas of icelanders  he established a norse settlement at vinland which is  ebatably in newfoundland in modern ay canada for many years this was thought to be only a mythological story  8212 more myth than reality  8212 but archaeological evidence has shown beyond a doubt that vikings reached canada the first viking archaeological site in the new world is  l 'anse aux meadows  a thousand ear ld way station discovered in 1960 on the northern tip of newfoundland the feature was a clear indication that vikings had visited north america centuries before columbus  8212 at least partially the myth was proven to be true archaeologists actually used clues from the sagas to guide their research leif erikson plaque in cambridge ma the vikings called america vineland because it was rich in grapes which made delicious wine when archaeologists discovered another site  the second viking settlement in america  things became much clearer not only have vikings visited the american continent but they actually colonized some parts of it  8212 or at least attempted to do so "the sagas suggest a short period of activity and a very brief and failed colonization attempt  says  douglas bolender  an archaeologist specializing in norse settlements "l 'anse aux meadows fits well with that story but is only one site point rosee could reinforce that story or completely change it if the dating is different from l 'anse aux meadows we could end up with a much longer period of norse activity in the new world  there is also other indirect evidence suggesting that vikings went to america icelandic sagas claim that in 1004 leif 8217  brother thorvald eiriksson was said to have sailed with a crew of 30 men spending the following winter at leif 8217  camp in the spring thorvald attacked the local population and was ultimately killed by an arrow but his crew appears to have remained in place just five years later in 1009 thorfinn the valiant supplied three ships with livestock and 160 men and women  8212 a proper colony accounts differ as to what happened to this colony but the sagas mention a peace agreement between the indigenous peoples and the norsemen so we have solid evidence that vikings  8212 leif and his extended family  8212 visited america and remained then for at least 10 years there is some evidence that they tried to establish an outpost  but the natives didn 8217  seem to appreciate their presence feeling threatened and outnumbered the vikings presumably left though they likely returned from time to time to trade another interesting piece of evidence was recently found by researchers analyzing viking tombs teeth filing researchers believe that the vikings learned the practice from some other culture but teeth filing was not done by any european culture the only culture to employ such a practice was in america polynesian yams and shakier claims another population who probably visited america way before columbus are the polynesians the main clue for this behavior is the inconspicuous sweet potato  am  image credits 5aday ov the oldest carbonized sweet potato evidence in the pacific hails back to about 1 00 a  500 years before columbus sailed to the americas but it wasn 8217  a convincing enough proof so it remained as a hunch more than anything else however french scientists found better samples from a herbarium collected by early european explorers through genetic analysis they were able to show that polynesians took the sweet potatoes from america and spread them across southeast asia and the pacific where they are now ubiquitous there are also studies which link brazilian dna to that of polynesians though another recent study put the findings under question it seems very likely that polynesians did reach america and established some kind of trade route if this happened it was before columbus 8217 time but it 8217  not clear if it was before the vikings another intriguing analysis on peruvian mummies found that at least one such mummy had been embalmed using resin from a tree that only grew only in oceania and new guinea both the mummy and the tree were dated to 1200 ad there is also a  8220 hina first 8221 theory but that 8217  highly speculative while a massive chinese fleet explored africa reaching present ay kenya there 8217  no real evidence to support that idea several explorers also claimed to have discovered the continent a few years before columbus but there 8217  almost no way to prove such claims the first explorers of america might have come from this area the first true americans so we 8217 e established that while columbus made america known to europe 8217  colonial powers he definitely wasn 8217  the first one polynesian sailors probably also visited south america but if we really want to get true here every time these explorers reached the continent natives were already there because america was first discovered by humans over 15 00 years ago after all when columbus got there and when the vikings got there there was always someone there to greet them the first explorers came from the frozen wastelands of siberia image via prezi exactly when this happened is also a heated debate  but recent studies place the earliest migration rate between 25 00 and 15 00 years ago technically you could say  they were the first ones to discover america tags america christopher columbus vikings share tweet share how much money are you losing by not going
