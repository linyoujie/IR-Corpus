armstrong and buzz aldrin at the wrong angle we all love conspiracy theories are you laughing now or are you slowly getting angry nbsp uch nonsense from bsp w ok then well you e obviously not very prone to falling for conspiracy theories just how many people believe in absurd stories of this kind has not been put into numbers nor do we know whether today in 2019 there are more of these people than before in any case crude conspiracy theories have become more visible through the internet and social media psychologists say followers of these ideas feel supported and they no longer feel they e part of a small minority but scientific experiments also show that conspiracy theorists enjoy believing the most absurd things in order to belong to a supposedly exclusive elitist circle of knowledge though psychological reasons behind why so many people still believe the moon landing was faked still need to be scientifically examined the trigger was a strange book by the american bill kaysing it was published in 1976 under the title  e never went to the moon  and it was a success many people believed the absurd theories kaysing was not a scientist technician nor an engineer he was

flag that neil armstrong and buzz aldrin rammed into the moon  regolith blows in the wind but that is not possible because there is no atmosphere on the moon science says the flag did not flap it only moved when the two astronauts touched it and rammed it into the ground on earth the atmosphere quickly slows down such light oscillations but on the moon — without atmosphere — the oscillations keep going for much longer in addition a cross strut was braced in the flag to give the impression it was blowing read more nbsp why aren 't jeff bezos and elon musk trying to colonize the moon 2 no stars in the photos conspiracy theorists say on the moon pictures no stars are to be seen so they were created in a studio science says it  true that on the moon — without an atmosphere to disturb things — we have a fantastic view of the starry cosmos but when the astronauts were on the moon it was always daytime one explanation is that the moon  surface the lander and the astronauts were so brightly illuminated by the sun that the weak light of the stars was not to be seen 3 the photos were too perfect conspiracy theorists say the hasselblad cameras carried by the astronauts at chest height had no viewfinder how could the astronauts take so many perfect photos with them science says not all pictures were perfect there are numerous blurred images in nasa  archives only the most beautiful ones have been published in addition the astronauts had time to practice with the hasselblad cameras on earth a special wide ngle lens simplified focusing and allowed larger image sections read more nbsp
