lunar landings are often questioned But who knows maybe it never happened and nothing is as it seems No American has ever been to the moon It  all just fake The moon landings Staged in TV studios where the scenes weren  even properly lit And then there were the amateur mistakes such as the waving US flag Pfffff As if flags  ave on the moon Without an atmosphere Fake A political conspiracy by

Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin at the wrong angle We all love conspiracy theories Are you laughing now Or are you slowly getting angry nbsp uch nonsense from bsp W OK then well you e obviously not very prone to falling for conspiracy theories Just how many people believe in absurd stories of this kind has not been put into numbers Nor do we know whether today in 2019 there are more of these people than before In any case crude conspiracy theories have become more visible through the internet and social media psychologists say Followers of these ideas feel supported and they no longer feel they e part of a small minority But scientific experiments also show that conspiracy theorists enjoy believing the most absurd things in order to belong to a supposedly exclusive elitist circle of knowledge Though psychological reasons behind why so many people still believe the moon landing was faked still need to be scientifically examined the trigger was a strange book by the American Bill Kaysing It was published in 1976 under the title  e never went to the Moon  And it was a success Many people believed the absurd theories Kaysing was not a scientist technician nor an engineer He was an author who wrote about agriculture cooking or saving on tax payments He came up with make elieve evidence to prove that moon landings actually never occurred Read more nbsp Towards the Moon Why Europe wants to work with China Does the flag really fly Of course not it  held up by a bar These are four of his most popular theories 1 The waving flag Conspiracy theorists say In the footage the US flag that Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin rammed into the moon  regolith blows in the wind But that is not possible because there is no atmosphere on the moon Science says The flag did not flap It only moved when the two astronauts touched it and rammed it into the ground On Earth the atmosphere quickly slows down such light oscillations But on the moon — without atmosphere — the oscillations keep going for much longer In addition a cross strut was braced in the flag to give the impression it was blowing Read more nbsp Why aren't Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk trying to colonize the moon 2 No stars in the photos Conspiracy theorists say On the moon pictures no stars are to be seen So they were created in a studio Science says It  true that on the moon — without an atmosphere to disturb things — we have a fantastic view of the starry cosmos But when the astronauts were on the moon it was always daytime One explanation is that the moon  surface the lander and the astronauts were so brightly illuminated by the sun that the weak light of the stars was not to be seen 3 The photos were too perfect Conspiracy theorists say The Hasselblad cameras carried by the astronauts at chest height had no viewfinder How could the astronauts take so many perfect photos with them Science says Not all pictures were perfect There are numerous blurred images in NASA  archives Only the most beautiful ones have been published In addition the astronauts had time to practice with the Hasselblad cameras on Earth A special wide ngle lens simplified focusing and allowed larger image sections Read more nbsp

diagonally Conspiracy theorists say Some photos show shadows that do not run in parallel to each other With the sun as the only light source however all shadows should run in parallel But they don  That  why spotlights must have been involved Science says Parallelism is always a matter of perspective nbsp arallel lines on a three imensional surface always appear as if they are converging if they are imaged two imensionally Think of railway tracks They seem to converge towards the horizon although they are always guaranteed to be parallel This is true on earth and also on the moon nbsp Read more nbsp Why NASA turned Apollo tough guy pilots to geologists Not enough yet There are other points that moon landing deniers make about dust radiation or shadows But there is no reliable evidence to suggest a moon landing conspiracy So the bottom line is The moon landings took place and not even the Soviets questioned it back then And that meant something in the Cold War era Also a total of about 400 00 people worked on the Apollo missions So there were enough witnesses and one of them would have mentioned something at some point What do you think 7 fun facts about the moon The moon is shrinking According to NASA research the moon is slowly losing heat which causes its surface to shrivel up like a grape turning into a raisin But that  not all its interior is shrinking The moon has become about 50 meters  50 feet  kinnier over the past several hundred million years 7 fun facts about the moon How did that US flag wave Conspiracy theorists believe that the lunar landing was a fake and that Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin walked around on July 21st 1969 on a soundstage instead of the moon They point to the fact that the flag planted by Aldrin waved as if moved by the wind which would be impossible in space  vacuum NASA  explanation Aldrin was twisting the flagpole while planting it in the ground 7 fun facts about the moon Scorching hot and freezing cold If it  summer in your neck of the woods you might be sweating right now But just remember temperatures are little more extreme on the moon When the sun hits its surface it can get up to 127 degrees Celsius  60 degrees Fahrenheit hot Without the warm glow temperatures can drop down to  53 degrees Celsius  243 degrees Fahrenheit  Brrr 7 fun facts about the moon Man on the moon The myth of a person living on the moon has existed for almost as long as Earth  satellite itself Some people see a face on the surface of the full moon composed of the dark lunar plains and the lighter lunar highlands Many cultures have tales about an actual person who committed some kind of misdeed and was banished to the moon for it Astronauts are yet to encounter them though 7 fun facts about the moon Drifting apart — the end of solar eclipses The moon is drifting away from Earth at a speed of almost 4 centimeters    inches per year The farther away our satellite is the smaller it appears to us In about 550 million years it l look too small to ever  over all of the sun even at its closest position to Earth That l mean no more total solar eclipses 7 fun facts about the moon Wolves don  care Ah howling at the moon — no old imey scary movie is complete without it But in fact wolves do not intensify their howling when a full moon rolls around and they don  direct their howls at the moon either They simply yowl at night which is also the time when a full moon is most visible That could be one reason our ancestors drew the connection 7 fun facts about the moon Moon alkers Not a very diverse bunch 12 humans have walked on the moon so far While they come from various professional fields they have a couple of things in common All of them are American all of them are white and all of them are men Let  see where the first non merican on the moon will be from — maybe it l be a woman and r person of color too Author Carla Bleiker DW recommends When America landed on the moon the whole world did It was an American mission to land on the moon But it would have been impossible without the rest of the world The Apollo program relied on a global network of tracking stations and their engineers  5 7 019 nbsp Wernher
