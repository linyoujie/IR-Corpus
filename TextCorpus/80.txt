Collins Petersen Updated July 19 2019 The definition of a day is the amount of time it takes an astronomical object to complete one full spin on its axis On Earth a day is 23 hours and 56 minutes but other planets and bodies rotate at different rates The Moon for example spins on its axis once every 29  days That means future lunar inhabitants will have to get used to a sunlight  34 ay 34 that lasts for about 14 Earth days and a  34 ight 34 that lasts about the same time Scientists typically measure days on other planets and astronomical objects in reference to Earth 39  day This standard is applied across the solar system to avoid confusion when discussing events that occur on those worlds However each celestial body 39  day is a different length whether it 39  a planet moon or asteroid If it turns on its axis it has a  34 ay and night 34 cycle The following table depicts the day lengths of the planets in the solar system Planet Length of Day Mercury 58  Earth days Venus 243 Earth days Earth 23 hours 56 minutes Mars 24 hours 37 minutes Jupiter 9 hours 55 minutes Saturn 10 hours 33 minutes Uranus 17 hours 14 minutes Neptune 15 hours 57 minutes Pluto 6  Earth days Mercury NASA ohns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory arnegie Institution of Washington ikimedia Commons ublic Domain The planet Mercury takes 58  Earth days to spin once on its axis That may seem long but think about this its year is only 88 Earth days long That 39  because it orbits very close to the Sun There 39  a twist however Mercury is gravitationally locked with the Sun in such a way that it rotates three times on its axis for every two times it goes around the Sun If people could live on Mercury they 39  experience one full day  unrise to sunrise every two Mercurian years Venus Kevin Gill lickr C BY 2  Planet Venus spins so slowly on its axis that one day on the planet lasts nearly 243 Earth days Because it 39  closer to the Sun than Earth is the planet has a 225 ay year So the day is actually longer than a year which means that Venus residents would only get to see two sunrises per year One more fact to remember Venus spins  34 ackward 34 on its axis compared to Earth which means those two yearly sunrises take place in the west and sunsets occur in the east  Mars ColiN00B ixabay At 24 hours and 37 minutes the Mars day length is very similar to Earth 39  which is one of the reasons that Mars is often thought of as something of a twin to Earth Because Mars is farther than Earth from the Sun however its year is longer than Earth 39  at 687 Earth days  Jupiter Aurelien  ixabay When it comes to gas giant worlds  34 ay length 34 is a more difficult thing to determine The outer worlds don 39  have solid surfaces although they do have solid cores covered with huge layers of clouds and layers of liquid metallic hydrogen and helium beneath the clouds On the gas giant planet Jupiter  the equatorial region of the cloud belts rotates at a rate of nine hours and 56 minutes while the poles rotate quite a bit faster at nine hours and 50 minutes The  34 anonical 34  hat is commonly accepted day length on Jupiter is determined by the rotation rate of its magnetic field which is nine hours 55 minutes long Saturn NASA  JPL  Space Science Institute ikimedia Commons ublic Domain Based on measurements of various parts of  gas giant Saturn  ncluding its cloud layers and magnetic field by the Cassini spacecraft planetary scientists determined that the official length of Saturn 39  day is ten hours and 33 minutes  Uranus Orange un  ld version user Brian0918 Wikimedia Commons ublic Domain Uranus is a weird world in many ways The most unusual thing about Uranus is that it 39  tipped over on its side and  34 olls 34 around the Sun on its side That means one axis or the other is pointed at the Sun during part of its 84 ear orbit The planet does rotate on its axis once every 17 hours and 14 minutes The length of day and the length of the Uranian year and the weird axial tilt all combine to create a day that 39  as long as a season on this planet  Neptune Kevin Gill from Los Angeles CA United States ikimedia Commons C BY 2  The gas giant planet Neptune has a day length of approximately 15 hours It took scientists a number of years to calculate the rotation rate of this gas giant They accomplished the task by studying images of the planet as features rotated around in its atmosphere No spacecraft has visited Neptune since Voyager 2 in 1989 so Neptune 39  day must be studied from the ground Pluto NASA HUAPL wRI ikimedia Commons ublic Domain Dwarf planet Pluto has the longest year of all the known planets  o far  at 248 years Its day is a lot shorter but still longer than Earth 39  at six Earth days and 9  hours Pluto is tipped over on its side at an angle of 122 degrees with respect to the Sun As a result during part of its year portions of Pluto 39  surface are either in continuous daylight or constant night ime  Key Takeaways The Earth is the only planet with an approximately 24 our day Jupiter has the shortest day of all the planets A day on Jupiter lasts only nine hours and 55 minutes Venus has the longest day of all the planets A day on Venus lasts 243 Earth days  Uranus More than Just a Distant Dot of Light Rotation and Revolution Two Important Astronomy Terms Fascinating Astronomy Facts All About Planet Venus How to Use Your
