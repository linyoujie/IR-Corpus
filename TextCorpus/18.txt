not a well known figure during his lifetime But today he is famous for being an eccentric yet passionate British mathematician who conceived modern computing and played a crucial part in the Allied victory over Nazi Germany in WW2 He was also a victim of mid 0th Century attitudes to homosexuality – he was chemically castrated before dying at the age of 41 1926 Discouraged at school Alan Turing spent much of his early life separated from his parents as his father worked in the British administration of India At 13 years old he was sent to Sherborne School a large boarding school in Dorset The rigid education system gave his free anging scientific mind little encouragement so Turing studied advanced modern scientific ideas such as relativity on his own running far ahead of the school syllabus Alan Turing aged 15 at Westcott House Sherborne School 1930 Devastated but inspired by his friend x27  death The situation changed when Alan Turing became intensely attracted to another able pupil Christopher Morcom He was inspired to communicate more and also to become an academic success But Christopher died suddenly from tuberculosis Devastated Turing wanted to believe that Christopher's mind somehow lived on His emotional turmoil involved a scientific fascination with the problem of mind and brain that underlay his later work Andrew Hodges talks about the profound effect Christopher Morcom's death had on Alan Turing Clip from Horizon  BC Two  1935 A new home in Cambridge uring won a scholarship to King x27  College Cambridge and took the Mathematics degree with distinction He thrived in a culture that encouraged his scientific interests and as a young gay man he also found protection in the liberal ambiance the college provided At just 22 he was elected to a Fellowship Turing was already on track for a distinguished career in pure mathematics Yet his unusual interest in finding practical uses for abstract mathematical ideas was to push him in an altogether different direction Turing's work in probability theory won him a Fellowship of King x27  College University of Cambridge in 1935 1936 Founder of modern computing In 1936 Turing published a paper that is now recognised as the foundation of computer science Turing analysed what it meant for a human to follow a definite method or procedure to perform a task For this purpose he invented the idea of a'Universal Machine' that could decode and perform any set of instructions Ten years later he would turn this revolutionary idea into a practical plan for an electronic computer capable of running any program Jim Al halili explains how Turing invented the idea of feeding one machine different instructions Clip from Order and Disorder  BC Four  1939 Breaking the Enigma code After two years at Princeton developing ideas about secret ciphers Turing returned to Britain and joined the government's code reaking department In July 1939 the Polish Cipher Bureau passed on crucial information about the Enigma machine which was used by the Germans to encipher all its military and naval signals After September 1939 joined by other mathematicians at Bletchley Park Turing rapidly developed a new machine  he'Bombe' capable of breaking Enigma messages on an industrial scale The Bombe – designed by Turing – was used to crack Nazi ciphers Marcus du Sautoy watches it in action Clip from Horizon  BC Two  1941 End of a brief engagement In 1941 Turing's section'Hut 8' mastered the German submarine communication system that was vital to the battle of the Atlantic In the course of this exciting work he found the friendship of another mathematician Joan Clarke Turing proposed to her but immediately told her of his'homosexual tendencies' and the engagement soon ended After this he became more confident in developing his homosexual life Meanwhile the war took a new turn as America joined the war Joan Murray formerly Joan Clarke talks about her relationship with Alan Turing Clip from Horizon  BC Two  1944 The electronic connection Turing worked on other technical innovations during the war – in particular a system to encrypt and decrypt spoken telephone conversations Codenamed Delilah it was successfully demonstrated using a recording of one of Winston Churchill x27  speeches but was never used in action However it gave Turing hands n experience of working with electronics and led to a position at the National Physical Laboratory  PL  where he worked on what he sometimes described as an'electronic brain' Turing was recruited to the National Physical Laboratory in 1945 1946 Designs a first electronic computer In March 1946 Turing produced a detailed design for what was called the Automatic Computing Engine  CE  This was a digital computer in the modern sense storing programs in its memory His report emphasised the unlimited range of applications opened up by this technological revolution and software developments ahead of parallel American developments Yet his relationship with NPL soured and he left in 1948 before a pilot version of the ACE was made in 1950 Engineer Donald Bayley describes Turing's frustration at not being able to work on the construction of the ACE Clip from Horizon  BC Two  1950 Can a machine think Turing moved to the University of Manchester where electronic engineers had already demonstrated a very small stored rogram computer Now he focused on the use of computers His main theme had been in investigating the power of a computer to rival human thought In 1950 he published a philosophical paper including the idea of an'imitation game' for comparing human and machine outputs now called the Turing Test This paper remains his best known work and was a key contribution to the field of Artificial Intelligence A team of scientists work on the Baby – formally known as the Manchester Small cale Experimental Machine 1951 A theory of life Turing turned to a completely new scientific project which exploited his ability to use the Manchester computer It was the problem of understanding the biological patterns – spots stripes flower petals – of nature He proposed an explanation in terms of chemical interactions and developed equations for them His paper on this theory completed in 1951 became a classic and is still the subject of intense investigation 60 years later In the same year he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society for his earlier work Why do we see patterns on animals Prof Jim Al halili and Prof Ian Stewart explain Turing's theory Clip from The Secret Life of Chaos  BC Four  1952 Convicted for gross indecency All male homosexual activity was illegal until 1967 and Turing was prosecuted when an affair with a young man came to the notice of the police He made a statement lacking any element of contrition and was treated severely Rather than go to prison he accepted probation on the condition of having hormonal treatment which was in effect a chemical castration His security clearance was revoked ending ongoing work with the government code reaking department – now called GCHQ  overnment Communications Headquarters  His reaction was one of defiance and bravado in particular escaping British law by going abroad to Norway and Greece"Yours in distress  Close friend Dr Norman Routledge reads a letter he received from Turing following his conviction Clip from Horizon  BC Two  1954 His final year Turing's problems were not over Defined as a security risk he was harassed by police surveillance Alan Turing was found dead in bed by his cleaner on 8 June 1954 He had died from cyanide poisoning the day before A partly eaten apple lay next to his body The coroner's verdict was suicide His mother argued he had accidentally ingested cyanide during an amateur chemistry experiment but he had probably planned his death to allow her to think this Did Turing take his own life or was his death an accident Joan Murray gives her view Clip from Horizon  BC Two
