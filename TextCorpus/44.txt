more prominent ones sixth century — irish monks this  heory is actually more of a legend a sixth entury irish monk named saint brendan supposedly sailed to north america on a currach — a wood ramed boat covered with animal skin his alleged journey is detailed in the ancient annals of ireland brendan was a real historical figure who traveled extensively in europe but there is no evidence that he ever made landfall in north america in 1976 writer tim severin set out to prove that such a journey was possible severin built the brendan  an exact replica of a sixth entury currach  and sailed along a route described by the traveling monks he eventually landed in canada 10th century — the vikings the vikings early expeditions to north america are well documented and accepted as historical fact by most scholars around the year 1000 a   the viking explorer leif erikson son of erik the red sailed to a place he called  inland  in what is now the canadian province of newfoundland erikson and his crew didn  stay long — only a few years — before returning to greenland relations with native north americans were described as hostile this much had long been known from the icelandic sagas but until 1960 there was no proof of erikson  american sojourns that year norwegian explorer helge ingstad and his wife archaeologist anne stine ingstad unearthed an ancient norse settlement during the next seven years the ingstads and an international team of archaeologists exposed the foundations of eight separate buildings in 1969 congress designated oct 9 as  eif erikson day  15th century — the chinese this theory is espoused by a small group of scholars and amateur historians led by gavin menzies a retired british naval officer it asserts that a muslim hinese eunuch ariner from the ming dynasty discovered america — 71 years before columbus zheng he was a real historical figure who commanded a huge armada of wooden sailing vessels in the early 15th century he explored southeast asia india and the east coast of africa using navigational techniques that were at the time cutting edge but menzies in his best elling 2003 book 1421 the year china discovered america  asserts that zheng he sailed to the east coast of the united states and may have established settlements in south america menzies based his theory on evidence from old shipwrecks chinese and european maps and accounts written by navigators of the time menzies scholarship though has been called into question many of his claims are presented  ithout a shred of proof  says historian robert finlay writing in the journal of world history  indeed most historians say the  hina first theory is full of holes  dash eric weiner want to know more read an excerpt from  ho was first? who discovered america for most of us the answer to that question is straightforward christopher columbus that  what we were taught in school and that is why we celebrate columbus day yet it is far from clear ut there are alternative theories about who got here first — some well ocumented others much more flimsy in their scholarship author russell freedom explores the various contenders for the title of  irst in his new book who was first discovering the americas  he shares his insights with npr when you started this project were you like the rest of us did you believe that christopher columbus discovered america and that was it end of story i was vaguely aware of the vikings but really what incited my interest was a book called 1421 the year china discovered america  that book has been largely debunked but what is clear is that there have been successive waves of immigration to the western hemisphere from outside where they came from and when they arrived and how they got here — that  all still speculative tell me about the irish monks who supposedly predated even the vikings that falls into the realm of legend but it  possible that they came across the north sea to what is now newfoundland before the vikings no one knows for sure and the vikings that is well established i visited the archeological site at the northern tip of newfoundland there is no question about it it has been definitely determined that the vikings were there for about 10 years — specifically leif erikson and his extended family is there any physical evidence that remains today yes the remains of their houses of their settlement there was an archeological dig that lasted six or seven years and then they reconstructed the settlement about 100 yards away what did leif erikson make of this new world it was full of wonderful resources timber and grapes coming from greenland as he did which had no timber or grapes to make wine these were two priceless discoveries that  why the vikings called it  inland or wine land so if it was so wonderful why didn  the vikings stay longer the indians didn  want them to stay the first encounter was when the vikings came across 10 indians taking naps under their overturned canoes — and the vikings killed them that did not set up a very good mutual relationship there were some attempts at trading but the vikings felt quite menaced and outnumbered and the indians did not appreciate their presence the vikings did return to north america but only for trading they never settled again what about the  hina first theory is there any evidence to support the notion that chinese mariners set foot in america before columbus there is credible evidence that a chinese fleet went as far as the coast of africa in present ay kenya it was the largest maritime fleet in the world under the command of zheng he a favorite of the emperor whether the fleet went around the horn of africa and then across the atlantic is speculative the theory has been widely shot down by experts in the field there is no real evidence the author uses a grab bag of evidence some of it is suggestive and some of it is ridiculous so if columbus wasn  first why does he get all of the credit he opened up america to europe which was the expansionist power at the time he was the one who made it possible for them to conquer the western hemisphere — and to bring with them the diseases that apparently wiped out 90 percent of the population he wasn  the first  nd neither were the vikings — that is a very euro entric view there were millions of people here already and so their ancestors must have been the first what did you find most surprising in researching this book for one thing the longevity of settlement of the western hemisphere — 20 00 years at least i don  think it  silly this quest for answers of who got here first you always want to know what happened before you it a human instinct to know where you came from and what proceeded you how did they get here who were they the fact that we don  know for sure makes it quite fascinating excerpt  ho was first? facebook twitter flipboard email october 5 2007 12 1 am et russell freedman read an excerpt from who was first by russell freedman before columbus for a long time most people believed that christopher columbus was the first explorer to  iscover america—the first to make a successful round rip voyage across the atlantic but in recent years as new evidence came to light our understanding of history has changed we know now that columbus was among the last explorers to reach the americas not the first five hundred years before columbus a daring band of vikings led by leif eriksson set foot in north america and established a settlement and long before that some scholars say the americas seem to have been visited by seafaring travelers from china and possibly by visitors from africa and even ice age europe a popular legend suggests an additional event according to an ancient manuscript a band of irish monks led by saint brendan sailed an ox ide boat westward in the sixth century in search of new lands after seven years they returned home and reported that they had discovered a land covered with luxuriant vegetation believed by some people today to have been newfoundland all along of course the two continents we now call north and south america had already been  iscovered  before european explorers arrived the americas were home to tens of millions of native peoples while those native american groups differed greatly from one another they all performed rituals and ceremonies songs and dances that brought back to mind and heart memories of the ancestors who had come before them and given them their place on earth who were the ancestors of those native americans where did they come from when did they arrive in the americas and how did they make their epic journeys as we dig deeper and deeper into the past we find that the americas have always been lands of immigrants lands that have been  iscovered time and again by different peoples coming from different parts of the world over the course of countless generations—going far back to the prehistoric past when a band of stone age hunters first set foot in what truly was an unexplored new world 1 admiral of the ocean sea christopher columbus was having trouble with his crew his fleet of three small sailing ships had left the canary islands nearly three weeks earlier heading west across the uncharted ocean sea as the atlantic was known he had expected to reach china or japan by now but there was still no sign of land none of the sailors had ever been so long away from the sight of land and as the days passed they grew increasingly restless and fearful the ocean sea was known also as the sea of darkness hideous monsters were said to lurk beneath the waves—venomous sea serpents and giant crabs that could rise up from the deep and crush a ship along with its crew and if the earth was flat as many of the men believed then they might fall off the edge of the world and plunge into that fiery abyss where the sun sets in the west what  more columbus was a foreigner—a red eaded italian commanding a crew of tough seafaring spaniards—and that meant he couldn  be trusted finally the men demanded that columbus turn back and head for home when he refused some of the sailors whispered together of mutiny they wanted to kill the admiral by throwing him overboard but for the moment the crisis passed columbus managed to calm his men and persuade them to be patient a while longer   am having serious trouble with the crew    complaining that they will never be able to return home  he wrote in his journal  hey have said that it is insanity and suicidal on their part to risk their lives following the madness of a foreigner    i am told by a few trusted men  nd these are few in number  that if i persist in going onward the best course of action will be to throw me into the sea some night  all along columbus had been keeping two sets of logs one which he kept secretly and showed to no one was accurate recording the distance really sailed each day the other log which he showed to his crew hoping to reassure them that they were nowhere near the edge of the world deliberately underestimated the miles they had covered since leaving spain they sailed on for another two weeks and still saw nothing there were more rumblings of protest and complaint from the crew the men seemed willing to endure no more on october 10 columbus announced that he would give a fine silk coat to the man who first sighted land the sailors greeted that offer with glum silence what good was a silk coat in the middle of the sea of darkness later that day columbus spotted a flock of birds flying toward the southwest—a sign that land was close he ordered his ships to follow the birds the next night the moon rose in the east shortly before midnight about two hours later at two a  on october 12 a sailor on one of columbus  ships the pinta saw a white stretch of beach shouted  and land  and fired a cannon at dawn the three ships dropped anchor in the calm blue waters just offshore they had arrived at an island in what we now call the bahamas excited crew members crowded the decks people were standing on the beach waiting to greet them the natives had no weapons other than wooden fishing spears and they were practically naked who were these people and what place was this columbus supposed that his fleet had landed on one of the many islands that marco polo had reported lay just off the coast of asia they must have reached the indies he thought—islands reputedly near india and known today as the east indies so he decided that those people on the beach must be  ndians  the name by which they have been known ever since china and japan he believed lay a bit farther to the north though christopher columbus was an italian born in genoa he had lived for years in portugal where he worked as a bookseller a mapmaker and a sailor he had sailed on portuguese voyages as far as iceland in the north atlantic and down the coast of africa in the south atlantic during his days at sea he read books on history geography and travel like most educated people at the time columbus believed that the earth was round—not flat as some ignorant folks still insisted the ocean sea was seen as a great expanse of water surrounding the land mass of eurasia and africa which stretched from europe in the west to china and japan in the far distant east if a ship left the coast of europe sailed west toward the setting sun and circled the globe it would reach the shores of asia—or so columbus thought in the past european explorers and traders had taken the overland route to the far east with its precious silks and spices they traveled for months by horse and camel along the silk road an ancient caravan trail that crossed deserts and climbed dizzying mountain peaks marco polo had followed the silk road on his famous journey to china two centuries earlier but recently this land route to asia controlled in part by the turks had been closed to europeans and in any case columbus was convinced that he could find an easier and faster route to asia by sailing west there were plenty of stories circulating in those years about the possibility of sailing directly from europe to asia an idea first considered by the ancient greeks columbus owned a book called imago mundi  or image of the world  by a french scholar pierre d illy who argued that the ocean sea wasn  as wide as it seemed and that a ship driven by favorable winds could cross it in a few days next to that passage in the margin of the book columbus had written  here is no reason to think that the ocean covers half the earth  in 1484 he proposed his bold scheme of sailing west to china to king john ii of portugal a monarch who had paid much attention to the discovery of new lands portugal was europe  leading maritime power portuguese explorers in search of slaves ivory and gold had already discovered rich kingdoms and colossal rivers in western africa and would soon reach the cape of good hope at africa  southern tip from there they would be able to sail across the indian ocean to the famed spice islands of southeast asia king john listened to what columbus had to say then submitted the italian sailor  plan to a committee of mapmakers astronomers and geographers the distinguished experts declared that asia must be much farther away than columbus thought they said that no expedition could be fitted out with enough food and water to sail across such an enormous expanse of sea rejected by the portuguese king columbus decided to approach king ferdinand and queen isabella of spain a country he had never before visited well onnected friends gave him letters of introduction to the inner circle of the spanish royal court ferdinand and isabella seemed curious about the route to asia that columbus proposed like king john they too appointed a committee of inquiry to consider the matter but those experts came to the same negative conclusion columbus  claim about the distance to china and the ease of sailing there could not possibly be true columbus persisted he talked at length to members of the spanish court and convinced some of them but ferdinand and isabella twice rejected his appeal for ships finally angry and impatient after six discouraging years in spain he threatened to seek support from the king of france columbus actually set out for france riding a mule down a dusty spanish road with that royal advisors persuaded ferdinand and isabella to change their minds if another king sponsored columbus and his expedition turned out to be a success then the spanish monarchs would be embarrassed they would be criticized in spain let columbus risk his life the advisors said let him seek out  he grandeurs and secrets of the universe  if he succeeded spain would win much glory and would overcome the portuguese lead in the race to exploit the riches of asia and so ferdinand and isabella decided to take a chance they dispatched a messenger to intercept columbus on the road and bring him back to court they were ready to grant him a hereditary title admiral of the ocean sea and the right to a tenth of any riches—pearls gold silver silks spices—that he brought back from his voyage and they agreed to supply two ships for his expedition columbus himself raised the money to hire a third ship a half hour before sunrise on august 3 1492 the nina  the pinta  and the santa maría sailed from the port of palos spain carrying some ninety crew members in all they were small lightweight ships called caravels swift and maneuverable each with three masts their white sails with big red crosses billowing before the wind they had on board food that would last—salted cod bacon and biscuits along with flour wine olive oil and plenty of water enough for a year in his small cabin columbus kept several hourglasses to mark the passage of time a compass and an astrolabe an instrument for calculating latitude by observing the movement of the sun the little fleet stopped for repairs at la gomera in the canary islands a spanish possession off the coast of morocco on september 6 after praying at the parish church of san sebastian  hich still looks out over the ocean today  columbus and his three ships set sail again heading due west moving now through the unknown waters of the ocean sea five weeks later on october 12 his worried crew finally sighted land columbus called the place where they landed san salvador—the first of many caribbean islands that he would name the natives who greeted him called their island guanahani they themselves were a people known as the tainos the largest group of natives inhabiting the islands of what we today call the west indies columbus tells us a few things about these now xtinct people he was impressed by their good looks and apparent robust health  hey are very well uilt people with handsome bodies and very fine faces  he wrote in his log  heir eyes are large and very pretty    these are tall people and their legs with no exceptions are quite straight and none of them has a paunch  many of the tainos had painted their faces or their whole bodies black or white or red and as columbus and his men noticed right away some of them wore gold earrings and nose rings they offered gifts to the european visitors—parrots wooden javelins and balls of cotton thread from san salvador columbus sailed on to several more islands still believing that he was close to japan  ecause all my globes and world maps seem to indicate that the island of japan is in this vicinity  he stopped at cuba and at hispaniola  he island that today contains haiti and the dominican republic  and he wrote enthusiastically in his journal of the lush tropical beauty of the islands the sweet singing of birds  hat might make a man wish never to leave here  and the hospitality of the people  hey gave my men bread and fish and whatever they had  and later  hey brought us all they had in this world knowing what i wanted and they did it so generously and willingly that it was wonderful  the tainos lived in large airy wooden houses with palm roofs they slept in cotton hammocks sat on wooden chairs carved in elaborate animal shapes and kept small barkless dogs and tame birds as pets they were skilled farmers fishermen and boat builders who traveled from island to island in long brightly painted canoes carved from tree trunks each of which carried as many as 150 people they told columbus that they called themselves tainos a word meaning  ood  to distinguish themselves from the  ad caribs their fierce warlike neighbors who raided taino villages carried off their girls as brides and the tainos insisted ate human flesh to fend off carib attacks the tainos painted themselves red and fought back with clubs bows and arrows and spears propelled by throwing sticks the tainos themselves were not warlike columbus reported to his monarchs  hey are an affectionate people free from avarice and agreeable to everything i certify to your highnesses that in all the world i do not believe there is a better people or a better country they love their neighbors as themselves and they have the softest and gentlest voices in the world and are always smiling  a village chief gave columbus a mask with golden eyes and large ears of gold and the spaniards were already aware that many of the tainos wore gold jewelry they kept asking where the gold came from after much searching they found a river on the island of hispaniola where  he sand was full of gold and in such quantity that it is wonderful    i named this el rio del oro   he river of gold  columbus built a small fort nearby and left thirty ine men behind to collect gold samples and await the next spanish expedition still believing that he had discovered unknown islands near the shores of asia he sailed back to spain with some gold from hispaniola and with ten indians he had kidnapped so he could train them as interpreters and exhibit them at the royal court one of the indians died at sea he returned to a triumphant welcome it was said that when ferdinand and isabella received him at their court in barcelona  here were tears in the royal eyes  they greeted columbus as a hero inviting him to ride with them in royal processions a second voyage was planned this time the monarchs gave columbus seventeen ships about fifteen hundred men and a few women to colonize the islands he was instructed to continue his explorations establish gold mines install settlers develop trade with the indians and convert them to christianity columbus returned to hispaniola in the fall of 1493 he hoped to find huge amounts of gold on the island but the mines yielded much less gold than expected and the european crops planted by the settlers wilted in the tropical climate some settlers began to lord it over the indians stealing their possessions abducting their wives and seizing captives to be shipped to spain and sold as slaves thousands of tainos fled to the mountains to escape capture others vowing to avenge themselves attacked any spaniards they found in small groups and set fire to their huts while columbus was a courageous and enterprising mariner he proved to be a poor governor unable to control the greed of his followers in 1496 he was called back to spain to answer complaints about his management of the colony when he appeared at court before ferdinand and isabella he found the king and queen were still willing to support his explorations columbus gave them a  ood sample of gold    and many masks with eyes and ears of gold and many parrots  he also presented to the monarchs  iego  the brother of a taino chief who was wearing a heavy gold collar these hints that more gold might be forthcoming encouraged ferdinand and isabella to send columbus back to the indies this time with eight ships when he returned to hispaniola on his third voyage in 1498 he found the island in turmoil torn by rivalries and disagreements among the settlers many colonists unable to make a living from the gold mines or by farming were clamoring to return to spain others rivals of columbus who wanted to gain control of the colony rebelled against his rule when word of the conflict reached spain the king and queen sent an emissary francisco de bobadilla to investigate the uprising and take charge of the government columbus it seems made the mistake of arguing with the royal emissary and challenging his credentials he was promptly arrested and with his two brothers was shipped back to spain to face charges of wrongdoing  obadilla sent me here in chains  he wrote to ferdinand and isabella when he landed in spain   swear that i do not know nor can i think why  though columbus was quickly pardoned by the spanish monarchs who felt he had been treated too harshly he was stripped of his right to govern the islands he had discovered and he lost his title as admiral of the ocean sea even so he was allowed to make one more voyage sailing across the caribbean and exploring the coast of central america this final expedition was cursed by bad luck two of columbus  ships became so infested with termites they sank when he headed back to spain he had to beach his remaining ships at st ann  bay in jamaica where he was marooned for a year before being rescued in the fall of 1504 he returned to spain an ill and disappointed man spanish colonists meanwhile had been settling in hispaniola cuba puerto rico jamaica and other islands in the west indies the local indians were put to work as forced laborers in the goldfields or on spanish ranches indians who resisted were killed sometimes with terrible brutality or were shipped to spain to be sold as slaves spanish missionaries denounced this mistreatment but with little effect   have seen the greatest cruelty and inhumanity practiced on these gentle and peace oving  ative peoples  father bartolomé de las casas would say a half century later  ithout any reason except for insatiable greed thirst and hunger for gold  as the number of spanish colonists increased the native population of the west indies quickly declined tens of thousands of native people were worked to death or died of smallpox measles and other european diseases to which they had no immunity as the tainos died off the colonists brought in black slaves from africa to labor on ranches and in the spreading sugar ane fields within fifty years the tainos had ceased to exist as a distinct race of people a few taino words survive today in spanish and even in english including hammock canoe hurricane savannah barbecue  and cannibal  columbus died in a spanish monastery on may 20 1506 at the age of fifty even still believing that he had found a new route to asia and that china and japan lay just beyond the islands he had explored by then other explorers were following the sea route pioneered by the admiral of the ocean sea and europeans were already speaking of columbus  discoveries as a  ew world  the first map of the world to show these newly discovered lands across the ocean sea appeared in 1507 a year after christopher columbus  death the mapmaker martin waldseemüller named the new world  merica  after the italian amerigo vespucci who had explored the coastline of south america and was the first to realize that it was a separate continent not part of asia columbus wasn  the first explorer to  iscover america his voyages were significant because they were the first to become widely known in europe they opened a pathway from the old world to the new
