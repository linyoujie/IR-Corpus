original oct 30 2014 the famed code reaking war hero now considered the father of computer science and artificial intelligence was criminally convicted and harshly treated under the u .  homophobic laws who was alan turing alan turing was a brilliant british mathematician who took a leading role in breaking nazi ciphers during wwii in his seminal 1936 paper he proved that there cannot exist any universal algorithmic method of determining truth in mathematics and that mathematics will always contain undecidable propositions  a0 is work is widely acknowledged as foundational research of computer science and artificial intelligence  a0 early life english scientist alan turing was born alan mathison turing on june 23 1912 in maida vale london england at a young age he displayed signs of high intelligence which some of his teachers recognized but did not necessarily respect when turing attended the well nown independent sherborne school at the age of 13 he became particularly interested in math and science after sherborne turing enrolled at king pos  college  niversity of cambridge in cambridge england studying there from 1931 to 1934 as a result of his dissertation in which he proved the central limit theorem turing was elected a fellow at the school upon his graduation in 1936 turing delivered a paper  uot n computable numbers with an application to the entscheidungsproblem quot in which he presented the notion of a universal machine  ater called the  x201c niversal turing machine quot and then the  uot uring machine uot  capable of computing anything that is computable it is considered the precursor to the modern computer over the next two years turing studied mathematics and cryptology at the institute for advanced study in princeton new jersey after receiving his ph  from princeton university in 1938 he returned to cambridge and then took a part ime position with the government code and cypher school a british code reaking organization cryptanalysis and early computers during world war ii turing was a leading participant in wartime code reaking particularly that of german ciphers he worked at bletchley park the gccs wartime station where he made five major advances in the field of cryptanalysis including specifying the bombe an electromechanical device used to help decipher german enigma encrypted signals turing x2019  contributions to the code reaking process didn x2019  stop there he also wrote two papers about mathematical approaches to code reaking which became such important assets to the code and cypher school  ater known as the government communications headquarters that the gchq waited until april 2012 to release them to the national archives of the united kingdom turing moved to london in the mid 940s and began working for the national physical laboratory among his most notable contributions while working at the facility turing led the design work for the automatic computing engine and ultimately created a groundbreaking blueprint for store rogram computers though a complete version of the ace was never built its concept has been used as a model by tech corporations worldwide for several years influencing the design of the english electric deuce and the american bendix g 5 x2014 redited by many in the tech industry as the world x2019  first personal computer x2014 mong other computer models turing went on to hold high anking positions in the mathematics department and later the computing laboratory at the university of manchester in the late 1940s he first addressed the issue of artificial intelligence in his 1950 paper  uot omputing machinery and intelligence quot and proposed an experiment known as the  x201c uring test x201d  2014 n effort to create an intelligence design standard for the tech industry over the past several decades the test has significantly influenced debates over artificial intelligence homosexuality conviction and death homosexuality was illegal in the united kingdom in the early 1950s so when turing admitted to police called to his house after a january 1952 break n that he pos  had a sexual relationship with the perpetrator 19 ear ld arnold murray he was charged with gross indecency following his arrest turing was forced to choose between temporary probation on the condition that he receive hormonal treatment for libido reduction or imprisonment he chose the former and soon underwent chemical castration through injections of a synthetic estrogen hormone for a year which eventually rendered him impotent as a result of his conviction turing pos  security clearance was removed and he was barred from continuing his work with cryptography at the gccs which had become the gchq in 1946 turing died on june 7 1954 following a postmortem exam it was determined that the cause of death was cyanide poisoning the remains of an apple were found next to the body though no apple parts were found in his stomach the autopsy reported that  uot our ounces of fluid which smelled strongly of bitter almonds as does a solution of cyanide uot was found in the stomach trace smell of bitter almonds was also reported in vital organs the autopsy concluded that the cause of death was asphyxia due to cyanide poisoning and ruled a suicide  a0 in a june 2012 bbc article philosophy professor and turing expert jack copeland argued that turing pos  death may have been an accident the apple was never tested for cyanide nothing in the accounts of turing pos  last days suggested he was suicidal and turing had cyanide in his house for chemical experiments he conducted in his spare room awards recognition and royal pardon shortly after world war ii alan turing was awarded an order of the british empire for his work for what would have been his 86th birthday turing biographer andrew hodges unveiled an official english heritage blue plaque at his childhood home in june 2007 a life ize statue of turing was unveiled at bletchley park in buckinghamshire england a bronze statue of turing was unveiled at the university of surrey on october 28 2004 to mark the 50th anniversary of his death additionally the princeton university alumni weekly named turing the second most significant alumnus in the history of the school  x2014 james madison held the no 1 position turing was honored in a number of other ways particularly in the city of manchester where he worked toward the end of his life in 1999 time magazine named him one of its  uot 00 most important people of the 20th century quot saying  uot he fact remains that everyone who taps at a keyboard opening a spreadsheet or a word rocessing program is working on an incarnation of a turing machine quot turing was also ranked 21st on the bbc nationwide poll of the  uot 00 greatest britons uot in 2002 by and large turing has been recognized for his impact on computer science with many crediting him as the  uot ounder uot of the field following a petition started by john graham umming then rime minister gordon brown released a statement on september 10 2009 on behalf of the british government which posthumously apologized to turing for prosecuting him as a homosexual  uot his recognition of alan pos  status as one of britain pos  most famous victims of homophobia is another step towards equality and long overdue but even more than that alan deserves recognition for his contribution to humankind quot brown stated  uot t is thanks to men and women who were totally committed to fighting fascism people like alan turing that the horrors of the holocaust and of total war are part of europe pos  history and not europe pos  present so on behalf of the british government and all those who live freely thanks to alan pos  work i am very proud to say we pos e sorry you deserved so much better quot in 2013 queen elizabeth ii posthumously granted turing a rare royal pardon almost 60 years after he committed suicide three years

innocent of any crime today in july 2019 the bank of england announced that turing would appear on the uk pos  new  xa3 0 note along with images of his work  a0 he famed scientist was chosen from a
