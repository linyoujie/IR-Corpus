mathematician Charles Babbage designed a Victorian ra computer called the Analytical Engine This is a portion of the mill with a printing mechanism  mage Â© Science Museum  Science  mp Society Picture Library The computer was born not for entertainment or email but out of a need to solve a serious number runching crisis By 1880 the U  population had grown so large that it took more than seven years to tabulate the U  Census results The government sought a faster way to get the job done giving rise to punch ard based computers that took up entire rooms Today we carry more computing power on our smartphones than was available in these early models The following brief history of computing is a timeline of how computers evolved from their humble beginnings to the machines of today that surf the Internet  play games and stream multimedia in addition to crunching numbers 1801  In France Joseph Marie Jacquard invents a loom that uses punched wooden cards to automatically weave fabric designs Early computers would use similar punch cards 1822  English mathematician Charles Babbage conceives of a steam riven calculating machine that would be able to compute tables of numbers The project funded by the English government is a failure More than a century later however the world  first computer was actually built  1890  Herman Hollerith designs a punch card system to calculate the 1880 census accomplishing the task in just three years and saving the government   million He establishes a company that would ultimately become IBM 1936  Alan Turing presents the notion of a universal machine later called the Turing machine capable of computing anything that is computable The central concept of the modern computer was based on his ideas 1937  J  Atanasoff a professor of physics and

graphical user interface  UI   This marks the evolution of the computer from a specialized machine for scientists and mathematicians to technology that is more accessible to the general public 1969  A group of developers at Bell Labs produce UNIX an operating system that addressed compatibility issues Written in the C programming language UNIX was portable across multiple platforms and became the operating system of choice among mainframes at large companies and government entities Due to the slow nature of the system it never quite gained traction among home PC users 1970  The newly formed Intel unveils the Intel 1103 the first Dynamic Access Memory  RAM chip 1971  Alan Shugart leads a team of IBM engineers who invent the  loppy disk  allowing data to be shared among computers 1973

described as the  orld  first minicomputer kit to rival commercial models  Two  omputer geeks  Paul Allen and Bill Gates offer to write software for the Altair using the new BASIC language On April 4 after the success of this first endeavor the two childhood friends form their own software company Microsoft nbsp 1976  Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak start Apple Computers on April Fool  Day and roll out the Apple I the first computer with a single ircuit board according to Stanford University  nbsp The TRS 0 introduced in 1977 was one of the first machines whose documentation was intended for non eeks  mage credit Radioshack 1977  Radio Shack  initial production run of the TRS 0 was just 3 00 It sold like crazy For the first time non eeks could write programs and make a computer do what they wished 1977  Jobs and Wozniak incorporate Apple and show the Apple II at the first West Coast Computer Faire It offers color graphics and incorporates an audio cassette drive for storage 1978
