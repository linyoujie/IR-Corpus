takes saturn 10 hours 33 minutes and 38 seconds to rotate once  asa pl pace science institute by jason daley smithsonianmag om january 23 2019 in theory determining the length of a day on a planet is pretty straightforward 8212 ust measure how long it takes to make one full rotation doing that with the gas giant saturn however has proven to be an astronomical headache the surface of the planet is more or less featureless meaning there are no mountains or craters to mark a full rotation and saturn  magnetic field is unusual preventing scientists from using electromagnetic measurements to determine the rotation but using data from the gone ut ot orgotten cassini spacecraft  researchers have studied the planet 8217  iconic rings to determine a day length of 10 hours 33 minutes and 38 seconds the teams reports in the astrophysical journal  meghan bartels at space om reports that researchers used the planet 8217  system of rings made of space dust rocks and ice particles like a seismometer the idea was first proposed in 1982 and expanded in 1990 but it couldn 8217  be tested until the cassini craft began exploring the rings up close the theory was that the interior of saturn vibrates at frequencies that cause variations in its gravitational field the particles in the rings researchers surmised would register those tiny changes in the tug of gravity as wave pattern which could then be used to determine how quickly the planet rotates  8220 he researchers used waves in the rings to peer into saturn  interior and out popped this long ought fundamental characteristic of the planet  221 cassini project scientist linda spilker says in a nasa press release   8220 nd it 8217  a really solid result the rings held the answer  221 when the voyager probes flew past saturn in 1980 and 1981 researchers used magnetic field readings to estimate a day length of 10 hours 39 minutes and 23 seconds when cassini reached the planet it also used magnetic field measurements to estimate the length of a day getting a range of results from 10 hours and 36 minutes to 10 hours and 48 minutes the slight discrepancies arise because saturn 8217  magnetic field is almost perfectly aligned with its rotational axis unlike the magnetic fields of planets like earth jupiter uranus and neptune which are a bit askew when an off ilter magnetic field swings around the rotational axis it creates periodic radio signals that can be used to calculate its rotation but saturn 8217  top ike rotation doesn 8217  give off the same signals making it difficult to get an accurate rotation time the situation frustrated astronomers for decades even after cassini studied saturn from orbit for over a decade scientists still couldn 8217  solve the day ength conundrum  8220 t 8217  a bit embarrassing  221 michele dougherty a physicist at imperial college london who studies saturn 8217  magnetic field told bartels in another story last october   8220 e were in orbit there for 13 years and we still can  say how long a day on saturn is  221 now researchers don 8217  have to be so ashamed but there is still room for improvement bartels reports there is a margin of error on the latest calculation and the actual day length could be between a minute and 52 seconds longer or up to 19 seconds shorter 8212 hough that  a huge improvement on the previous 12 inute margin of error like this
