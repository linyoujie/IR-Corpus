of the macintosh and the revolution in the dtp industry  to the tech ndustry behemoth that we know and love today so sit back as we take a stroll down memory lane why not brush up on what really happened before you go and watch the steve jobs movie  with its interesting interpretations of several bsp mportant events in the company  history on 1 april 1976 apple was founded making the company 41 years old as of the 1 april 2017  here  a historical breakdown of the company the history of apple our apple history feature includes information about the foundation of apple and the years that followed we look at how jobs met woz and why apple was named apple the apple i and the debut of the apple ii apple  visit to xerox and the one utton mouse the story of the lisa versus the macintosh apple   984 advert directed by ridley scott the macintosh and the dtp revolution we go on to examine what happened between jobs and sculley leading to jobs departure from apple and what happened during the wilderness years when steve jobs wasn  at apple including apple  decline and ibm and microsoft  rise and how apple teamed up with ibm and motorola and eventually microsoft and finally the return of jobs to apple the foundation of apple the history of everyone  favourite start p is a tech fairytale of one garage three friends and very humble beginnings but we e getting ahead of ourselves… the two steves  nbsp jobs and wozniak  bsp  may have been apple  most visible founders but were it not for their friend ronald wayne there might be no iphone  ipad or imac today jobs convinced him to take 10 of the company stock and act as an arbiter should he and woz come to blows but wayne backed out 12 days later selling for just  00 a holding that would have been worth  2bn 40 years later ron wayne how jobs met woz jobs and woz  hat  steve wozniak were introduced in 1971 by a mutual friend bill fernandez who went on to become one of apple  earliest employees the two steves got along thanks to their shared love of technology and pranks jobs and wozniak joined forces initially coming up with pranks such as rigging up a painting of a hand showing the middle inger to be displayed during a graduaction ceremony at jobs school and a call to the vatican that nearly got them access to the pope the two friends were also using their technology know ow to build  lue boxes that made it possible to make long distance phone calls for free jobs and wozniak worked together on the atari arcade game breakout while jobs was working at atari and wozniak was working at hp  jobs had roped woz into helping him reduce the number of logic chips required jobs managed to get a good bonus for the work on breakout of which he gave a small amount to woz the first apple computer the two steves attended the homebrew computer club together a computer hobbyist group that gathered in california  menlo park from 1975 woz had seen his first mits altair there  which today looks like little more than a box of lights and circuit boards  nbsp nd was inspired by mits build t ourself approach  he altair came as a kit to make something simpler for the rest of us this philosophy continues to shine through in apple 's products today so woz produced the the first computer with a typewriter ike keyboard and the ability to connect to a regular tv as a screen later christened the apple i it was the archetype of every modern computer but wozniak wasn  trying to change the world with what he  produced  nbsp e just wanted to show off how much he  managed to do with so few resources speaking to npr  ational public radio in 2006 woz explained that  hen i built this apple i… the first computer to say a computer should look like a typewriter  it should have a keyboard  nbsp nd the output device is a tv set it wasn  really to show the world  hat here is the direction  t should go  n  it was to really show the people around me to boast to be clever to get acknowledgement for having designed a very inexpensive computer  jobs and woz it almost didn  happen though the woz we know now has a larger han ife personality  nbsp e  funded rock concerts and shimmied on dancing with the stars  nbsp ut as he told the sydney morning herald   was shy and felt that i knew little about the newest developments in computers  he came close to ducking out altogether and giving the club a miss let  be thankful he didn  jobs saw woz  computer recognised its brilliance and sold his vw microbus to help fund its production wozniak sold his hp calculator  hich cost a bit more than calculators do today  and together they founded apple computer inc on 1 april 1976 alongside ronald wayne why apple was named apple the name apple was to cause apple problems in later years as it was uncomfortably similar to that of the beatles publisher apple corps but its genesis was innocent enough speaking to byte magazine in december 1984  woz credited jobs with the idea  e was working from time to time in the orchards up in oregon i thought that it might be because there were apples in the orchard or maybe just its fructarian nature maybe the word just happened to occur to him in any case we both tried to come up with better names but neither one of us could think of anything better after apple was mentioned  according to the biography of steve jobs the name was conceived by jobs after he returned from apple farm he apparently thought the name sounded "fun spirited and not intimidating  the name also likely benefitted by beginning with an a which meant it would be nearer the front of any listings the apple logo there are other theories about the meaning behind the name apple the idea that it was named thus because newton was inspired when an apple fell out of a tree hitting him on the head is backed up by the fact that the original apple logo was a rather complicated illustration of newton sitting under a tree later the company settled on the bite out of an apple design for apple  logo  a far simpler logo design these logos are probably the reason for other theories about the meaning behind the name apple with some suggesting that the apple logo with a chunk taken out of it is a nod at computer scientist and enigma code reaker alan turing who committed suicide by eating a cyanide infused apple however according to rob janoff  the designer who created the logo the turing connection is simply  a wonderful urban legend  equally the bite taken out of the apple could represent the story of adam and eve from the old testament the idea being that the apple represents knowledge selling the apple i woz built each computer by hand and although he  wanted to sell them for little more than the cost of their parts  nbsp t a price at that would recoup their outlay as long as they shipped 50 units  jobs had bigger ideas jobs inked a deal with the byte shop in mountain view to supply it with 50 computers at  00 each this meant that once the store had taken its cut the apple i sold for  66 6  the legend is that wozniak liked repeating numbers and was unaware of the  umber of the beast conection nbsp byte shop was going out on a limb the apple i didn  exist in any great numbers and the nascent apple computer inc didn  have the resources to fulfil the order neither could it get them atari where jobs worked wanted cash for any components it sold him a bank turned him down for a loan and although he had an offer of   00 from a friend  father it wasn  enough in the end it was byte shop  purchase order that sealed the deal jobs took it to cramer electronics and as walter isaacson explains in steve jobs the exclusive biography  he convinced cramer  manager to call paul terrell owner of byte shop to verify the order  errell was at a conference when he heard over a loudspeaker that he had an emergency call  obs had been persistent  the cramer manager told him that two scruffy kids had just walked in waving an order from the byte shop was it real terrell confirmed that it was and the store agreed to front jobs the parts on thirty ay credit  an original apple i  n a case jobs was banking on producing enough working computers within that time to settle the bill out of the proceeds from selling completed units to byte shop the risk involved was too great for ronald wayne and it  ultimately this that saw him duck out  obs and woz didn  have two nickels to rub together  bsp wayne told nextshark in 2013   f this thing blew up how was that… going to be repaid did they have the money no was i reachable yes  family and friends bsp ere roped in to sit at a kitchen table and help solder the parts and once they  been tested jobs drove them over to byte shop when he unpacked them terrell who had ordered finished computers was surprised by what he found as michael moritz explains in return to the little kingdom   ome energetic intervention was required before the boards could be made to do anything terrell couldn  even test the board without buying two transformers… since the apple i didn  have a keyboard or a television no data could be funnelled in or out of the computer once a keyboard had been hooked to the machine it still couldn  be programmed without somebody laboriously typing in the code for basic since wozniak and jobs hadn  provided the language on a cassette tape or in a rom chip… finally the computer was naked it had no case  an original apple i board from the sydney powerhouse museum collection raspberry pi and the bbc  micro bit aside we probably wouldn 't accept such a computer today and even terrell was reluctant at first but as isaacson explains  obs stared him down and he agreed to take delivery and pay  the gamble had paid off and the apple i stayed in production from april 1976 until september 1977 with a total run of around 200 units their scarcity has made them collectors items and bonhams auctioned a working apple i in october 2014 for an eye atering  05 00 nbsp f your pockets aren  that deep briel computers nbsp replica 1 plus is a hardware clone of the apple i and ships at a far more affordable  99 fully built when you consider that only 200 were built the apple i was a triumph it powered its burgeoning parent company to almost unheard f rates of growth  nbsp o much so that the decision to build a successor can  have caused too many sleepless nights in the jobs and wozniak households the apple ii apple ii the success of the first apple computer meant that apple was able to go on to design its predecessor the apple ii debuted at the west coast computer faire of april 1977 going head to head with big ame rivals like the commodore pet it was a truly groundbreaking machine just like the apple computer before it with colour graphics and tape ased storage  ater upgraded to 5 5in floppies  memory ran to 64k in the top nd models and the image it sent to the ntsc display stretched to a truly impressive 280 x 192 which was then considered high resolution naturally there was a payoff and pushing it to such limits meant you had to content yourself with just six colours but dropping to a more reasonable 40 rows by 48 columns would let you enjoy as many as 16 tones at a time yes the apple ii  r apple   as it was styled was a true innovation and one that jobs biographer walter isaacson  credits with launching the personal computer industry the trouble is the specs alone weren  really enough to justify the   00 cost of the apple ii business users needed a reason to dip into their it budgets and it wasn  until some months later that the perfect excuse presented itself the world 's first  iller app  the first app on an apple computer visicalc dan bricklin dan bricklin was a student at harvard business school when he visualised  bsp a heads p display like in a fighter plane where i could see the virtual image  f a table of numbers hanging in the air in front of me i could just move my mouse eyboard calculator around on the table punch in a few numbers circle them to get a sum do some calculations… of course we  recognise that as a spreadsheet today but back in the late 1970s such things existed only on paper converting them for digital use would be no small feat but bricklin was unperturbed he borrowed an apple ii from his eventual publisher and set to work knocking out an alpha edition over the course of a weekend many of the concepts he used are still familiar today  in particular letters above each column and numbers by the rows to use as references when building formulae  ondering how it compares to numbers today here  our numbers review   the technological limitations inherent in the hardware meant that it didn  quite work as bricklin had first imagined the apple ii didn  have an incorporated display and although the mouse had been invented it wasn  bundled with the machine so the display became the regular screen and the mouse was swapped out for the apple ii  game paddle which bricklin described as being   dial you could turn to move game objects back and forth  you could move the cursor left or right and then push the  ire button and then turning the paddle would move the cursor up and down  it was far from perfect and working this way was sluggish so bricklin reverted to using the left and right arrow keys with the space bar in place of the fire button for switching between horizontal and vertical movement visicalc was unveiled in 1979 and described as   magic sheet of paper that can perform calculations and recalculations  we owe it a debt of gratitude for the part it played in driving sales of the apple ii and anchoring apple within the industry writing in morgan stanley  electronics letter  shortly before its launch analyst benjamin m rosen expounded his belief that visicalc was  o powerful convenient universal simple to use and reasonably priced that it could well become one of the largest elling personal computer programs ever   t could some day become the software tail that wags  nd sells the personal computer dog  how right he was as tim barry revealed in a later infoworld piece in which he described an experience that would have been familiar to many visicalc  hen i first used visicalc on an apple ii i wanted to get a version that could take advantage of the larger system capabilities of my cp  computer alas it was not to be  we ended up buying an apple ii just to run visicalc   fairly common reason for many apple sales i  told  apple itself credited the app with being behind a fifth of all series iis it sold apple ii success colour graphics so a piece of software worth a little more than  00 was selling a piece of hardware worth ten times as much that was uncharted territory but even with the right software the apple ii wouldn  have been a success if it hadn  adhered to the company  already established high standards the february 1984 edition of pc mag  looking back at the apple ii in the context of what it had taught ibm put some of its success down to the fact that  ts packaging did not make it look like a ham radio operator  hobby a low heat enerating switching power supply allowed the computer to be placed in a lightweight plastic case its sophisticated packaging differentiated it from   computers that had visible boards and wires connecting various components to the motherboard  more radically though the apple ii  bsp was the first of its type to provide usable colo   graphics  contained expansion slots for which other hardware manufacturers could design devices that could be installed into the computer to perform functions that apple has never even considered  in short apple had designed a computer that embodied what we came to expect of desktop machines through the 1980s 1990s and the first few years of this century  nbsp efore apple turned things on its head again and moved increasingly towards sealed boxes without the option for internal expansion almost six million series iis were produced over 16 years giving apple its second big hit really though the company was still getting started and its brightest days were still ahead for visicalc the future wasn  so bright largely because its developers weren  quick enough to address the exploding pc market rival lotus stepped in and its 1   quickly became the business standard it bought software arts visicalc  developer in 1985 and remained top dog until microsoft did to it what lotus had done to visicalc  nbsp t usurped it with a rival that established a new digital order that rival was excel which like visicalc appeared on an apple machine long before it was ported to the pc jump to top of article apple xerox and the one utton mouse apple has never been slow to innovate  nbsp xcept perhaps where product names are concerned we e approaching the eighties in our trip through the company  history and we e at the point where it  followed up the apple i and ii with the iii predictable eh the two steves founded the company with a trend ucking debut and had the gumption to target the industry 's biggest names with its two follow ups that must have left industry watchers wondering where it might go next the answer it turned out was palo alto xerox had established a research centre there  nbsp erox parc now simply called  arc nbsp  bsp here it was free to explore new technologies a long way from the corporate base on the opposite side of the country its work helped drive forward the tech that we still use every day such as optical media ethernet and laser printers  e aren  just talking about photocopiers  of most interest to mac users though is its revolutionary work on interface design the apple i nbsp ii and iii computers were text ased machines much like the earliest ibm pcs but jobs who was working on the lisa at the time wanted something more intuitive he convinced xerox to grant three days ' access to parc for him and a number of apple employees in exchange xerox won the right to buy 100 00 apple shares at  0 each to say this was a bargain would be a massive understatement apple has split its stock four times since then  nbsp n 1987 2000 2005 and 2014 companies do this when the price of a single share starts to get too high in an effort to stimulate further trading so assuming xerox held on to those shares it would have had 200 00 by 1987 400 00 by 2000 and 800 00 by 2005 the split in 2014 was rated at seven to one so xerox  holding would leap from 800 00 to 5 m selling them at today  prices would rake in  08m  450m  not bad for a three ay tour jobs was bowled over by the xerox alto a machine used widely throughout the park with a portrait display and graphical interface which was way ahead of its time it had been knocking around for a while by then but xerox which built 2000 units hadn 't been selling it to the public it wasn  small  nbsp bout the size of an under ounter fridge  nbsp ut it was still considered a  ersonal machine which was driven home by the user entric manner in which it was used it was the first computer to major on mouse use with a three utton gadget used to point at and click on objects on the screen jobs decreed that every computer apple produced from that point on should adopt a similar way of working speaking to walter isaacson some years later he described the revelation as  ike a veil being lifted from my eyes i could see what the future of computing was destined to be  the lisa and the macintosh it kicked off a race inside apple between the teams developing the lisa and the macintosh jeff raskin the official line at the time was that lisa stood for local integrated system architecture and the fact it was jobs daughter  name was purely coincidental it was a high nd business machine slated to sell at close to  0 00 convert that to today 's money and it would buy you a mid ange family car the project was managed by john couch formerly of ibm jeff raskin meanwhile was heading up development of the macintosh  which had smaller businesses and home users firmly in its sights and each team wanted to be the first to ship an apple computer with a graphical interface the lisa whichever team got their first apple  nbsp s a company  nbsp anted them to do it at a price that wasn  prohibitively expensive and that meant finding some cheaper solutions to the ones arrived at by xerox the alto 's mouse for example had three buttons and cost  00 jobs wanted something simpler and capped the price at  5 the result was a one utton mouse  hich maybe hasn  stood the test of time as well as jobs might have expected with most of us regularly requiring that ctrl lick or right lick  jobs was so excited by the potential of the mouse and graphical interface that he got himself more and more involved in the lisa  development to the extent that he started to bypass the management structure already in place the caused upsets and in 1982 matters came to a head the apple lisa had an advanced gui michael scott was apple  president and ceo at the time having been brought to the post by mark markkula  pple employee number three and investor to the tune of  50 00  the two men worked out a new corporate structure which sidelined jobs with immediate effect and handed control of the lisa project back to john couch jobs also stripped of responsibility for research and development within the company was little more than a figurehead that left him on the lookout for a new project perhaps inevitably he turned to the macintosh named in honour of raskin  favourite edible apple  he mcintosh   the macintosh had been in the works since 1979 so when jobs joined the team it was already well advanced that didn 't stop him making extensive changes though including the commission of a new external design and integration the graphical operating system raskin left the macintosh team when he and jobs fell out and jobs assumed control for the remainder of its development however this enforced switching of sides meant that jobs  nbsp echnically  nbsp nded up on the losing team the lisa launched in 1983 with its graphical user interface in place the macintosh debuted the following year the race had been won by the lisa it was a pyrrhic victory though the macintosh which we l be covering in more detail below was a success and apple  current computer line p  nbsp os devices aside  nbsp escends directly from that first consumer machine you can  say the same of the lisa it cost four times the price of the macintosh and although it had a higher resolution display and could address more memory it wasn  nearly as successful apple released seven applications for it covering all of the usual business bases but third party support was poor nonetheless apple didn 't give up the original lisa was followed by the lisa 2 which cost around half the price of its predecessor and used the same 3 in disks as the macintosh then in 1985 it rebranded the hard drive quipped lisa 2 as the macintosh xl and stimulated sales with a price cut at this point though the numbers didn  add up and the lisa had to go the macintosh went on to define the company by 1984 apple had proved twice over that it was a force to be reckoned with it had taken on ibm the biggest name in business computing and acquitted itself admirably the apple i and ii were resounding successes but while the apple iii and lisa had been remarkable machines they hadn 't captured the public imagination to the same degree as their predecessors apple needed another hit both to guarantee its future and to target the lower end of the market which to date it had largely ignored that hit we all now know was the macintosh the machine that largely guaranteed the company  future if you  like a visual guide to apple history take a look at our apple timeline in pictures and video all change jef raskin versus steve jobs the macintosh we l always remember steve jobs as the man who launched the macintosh but he only arrived on the project in 1981  nbsp wo years after jef raskin had started work on the low ost computer for home and business use jobs quickly stamped his mark on it and raskin left in 1982  before the product shipped we must give raskin credit for original idea and its name  is favourite kind of apple was the mcintosh but this was tweaked to avoid infringing copyright  but otherwise the machine that eventually launched was a fair way away from the one he 'd originally envisaged raskin  early prototypes had text ased displays and used function keys in place of the mouse for executing common tasks raskin later endorsed the mouse but with more than the single button that shipped with the macintosh it was jobs and bud tribble the latter of whom is still at apple  e is vice president of software technology  that really pushed the team to implement the graphical user interface  ui for which it became famous they saw the potential of the gui 's desktop metaphor after seeing one in use at xerox parc and they  already laid much of the groundwork for apple  own take on the system as part of the lisa project tribble tasked the macintosh team with doing the same for their own machine which in hindsight may have been the most important directive ever issued by anyone inside apple if the macintosh team had continued down the text nd eyboard path it  unlikely their product would have sold as well as it did  and apple as we know it might not exist today at all find out about the original mac team members  here are some of their stories  the macintosh project simpler and smarter through several iterations the prototype macintosh became both more able and less complex to build it had fewer chips and the apple engineers were able to push them further and faster by the time it was ready to launch the macintosh incorporated the kind of graphics hardware that would have cost tens of thousands of pounds to buy in any rival machine yet apple was aiming to sell it at a price that would put it in reach of the better eeled home user the final spec was radical for its day with a 6mhz motorola 68000 processor ramped up to 7 mhz 128kb of ram and a 9in black and white screen with a fixed 512 x 342 pixels to put that into perspective it 's not even enough to display an app icon from a retina lass ios device at its native resolution but it could still accommodate system software 1  – apple  fully graphical operating system the macintosh project good looks but it wasn  just what went on inside the box that made it such an attractive device the macintosh looked just good on the outside sure it was shrouded in beige plastic – but the all in one body incorporated the floppy drive and a handy carrying handle so you could easily take it with you wherever you needed to work it looked friendly too and that made it more approachable there were still some limitations though the original macintosh didn  have a hard drive so you had to boot from a floppy and could only temporarily eject the system disk when you needed to access applications and data apple partially fixed this shortcoming by offering an external add n drive which allowed users to keep the system disk in situ and delegate responsibility for apps and data to a second disk it was an expensive add n though and the external hard disk 20 which cost  495 and gave just 20mb of storage was still a year away from going on sale despite it limitations though many of the features established on that first macintosh are still in use today we e dropped the  ystem monicker in favour of  s  hich stands for operating system  but we still use the finder name which debuted there and both command and option appeared as modifier buttons on its keyboard  he latter has since been usurped by alt at least in the uk but the name lives on for many users   ou  be surprised by how many people are confused by the fact that apple still referrs to the option key on the mac keyboard even though on uk keyboards that key is known as alt find out more here  what is option on a mac  the macintosh project pixels the hardware was only half of the story coder bill atkinson had implemented a radical system by which the macintosh system software allowed for overlapping windows in a more efficient manner than the computers at parc had done and susan kare spent months developing a visual language in the form of on creen icons that have since become classics susan kare and the command logo she designed it 's kare that we have to thank for the on creen wrist watch  o indicate a background process hogging resources and the smiling mac – among others – as well as the seemingly illogical square and circles combination she chose for the command key  his is a common symbol in sweden where it 's used to denote a national heritage site  not a campsite as has been reported  her paint bucket and lasso graphics are used widely in other applications and the fonts she designed for use on the original macintosh which included chiacgo geneva and monaco are still in use today – albeit in finer forms the macintosh went on sale in january 1984 priced at   95 it wasn  cheap but it was good value for what you got and that was reflected in its sales by the beginning of may that same year apple had hit the landmark figure of 70 00 shipped units which was likely helped in no small part by a remarkable piece of advertising directed by ridley scott find out how the iphone 5s compares to the original 128k macintosh jump to top of article apple   984 advert nobody would ever deny that the original macintosh was a work of genius it was small relatively inexpensive  or its day and friendly it brought the gui – graphical user interface – to a mass audience and gave us all the tools we could ever need for producing graphics ich work that would have costs many times as much on any other platform yet right from the start it was in danger of disappointing us you see apple had built it up to be something quite astounding it was going to change the computing world we were told and as launch day approached the hype continued to grow it was a gamble – a big one – that any other company would likely have shied away from but then no other company employed steve jobs jobs understood what made the macintosh special and he knew that aside from the keynote address at which he would reveal it the diminutive machine needed a far from diminutive bit of publicity he put in a call to chiat ay apple 's retained ad agency and tasked them with filling sixty seconds during the third quarter break of super bowl xviii super bowl ads are always special but this was in a league of its own directed by blade runner 's ridley scott and filmed in shepperton studios in the uk its production budget stood somewhere between  50 00 and  00 00 depending on who is telling the story the premise was simple enough but the message was a gamble pitting apple directly against its biggest competitor ibm international business machines dominated the workplace of the early 1980s and the saying that 'nobody ever got fired for buying ibm ' was a powerful monicker working in its favour people trusted the brand staking their careers on the simple choice of ibm or one of the others as a result the others often missed out and if apple wasn 't going to languish among them it had to change that perception so the ad portrayed apple as humanity 's only hope for the future it dressed anya major an athlete who later appeared in elton john 's nikita video in a white singlet and red shorts with a picture of the mac on her vest she was bright fresh and youthful and a stark contrast to the cold blue shaven eaded drones all about her they plodded while she ran they were brainwashed by big brother who lectured them through an enormous screen but she hurled a hammer through the screen to free them from their penury even without the tagline the inference would have been clear but jobs apple ceo john sculley and chiat ay turned the knife the with the memorable slogan 'on january 24th apple computer will introduce macintosh and you l see why 1984 won  be like nineteen eighty our  it was a gutsy move never explicitly naming ibm and never showing the product it was promoting but today it  considered a masterpiece and has topped advertising age   list of the 50 greatest commercials ever made jobs and sculley loved it but when jobs played it to the board it got a frosty reception the board disliked it and sculley changed his mind suggesting that they find another agency but not before asking chiat ay to sell off the two ad slots they 'd already booked it into one of these was a minor booking slated to run on just ten local stations in idaho purely so the ad would qualify for the 1983 advertising awards chiat ay offloaded this as instructed but hung on to the super bowl break and claimed that it was unsellable as jobs nbsp iographer walter isaacson explains  culley perhaps to avoid a showdown with either the board or jobs decided to let bill campbell the head of marketing figure out what to do campbell a former football coach decided to throw the long bomb   think we ought to go for it, he told his team  thank goodness they did there are two ways to judge an ad one is how well it markets your brand and the other is how much money is makes you the 1984 promotion was a success on both fronts ninety ix million people watched its debut during the super bowl and countless others caught a replay as television stations right across the country re an it later that evening and over the following days fifty local stations included a story on it in their new bulletins which massively diluted the  00 00 cost of the original slot apple couldn  have booked itself a cheaper ad break if it had tried the revenue speaks for itself the ad combined with jobs ' now legendary keynote secured the company  future and kicked off a line of computers that  still with us today  nbsp lbeit in a very different configuration it  perhaps no surprise that following the success of the 1984 advert apple booked another super bowl slot the following year for a strikingly similar production this time filmed by ridley scott 's brother tony  emmings once again depicted a stream of drones plodding across the screen the colours were muted the soundtrack was downbeat and the drones were blindfolded so it was only by keeping a hand on the drone ahead of them that they could tell where they were headed only when the penultimate drone dropped off the cliff over which they were marching did the last in line realise that a change of course was called for  nbsp nd a switch to macintosh office it wasn  a great success as sterndesign  apple matters explains the advert  eft viewers with the feeling that they were inferior for not using the mac turns out that insulting the very people you are trying to sell merchandise to is not the best idea  wired put it succinctly

cheers that greeted  984 a year earlier  jump to top of article the macintosh and the dtp revolution the macintosh got off to a good start thanks to jobs spectacular unveiling its innovative design and the iconic  984 advert but it still needed a killer application like visicalc had been on the apple   if it was really going to thrive it found it in the shape of pagemaker backed up by the revolutionary apple laserwriter printer the   95 laserwriter introduced in march 1985  just over a year after the macintosh  nbsp as the first mass arket laser printer it had a fixed 1 mb internal memory for spooling pages and a motorola 68000 processor under the hood  nbsp he same as the brain of both the lisa and the macintosh  nbsp unning at 12mhz to put out eight 300dpi pages a minute it wasn  the first laser printer  nbsp ust as the macintosh wasn 't the first desktop machine and the ipod wasn  the first digital music player  nbsp ut in true apple style it was different  and that  what mattered functionally it was very similar to the first hp laserjet which used the same canon cx engine as the laserwriter and had shipped a year earlier at half the price however while hp had chosen to use its own in ouse control language apple opted for adobe 's postscript which remains a cornerstone of desktop publishing to this day it was a neat fit for adobe which had been founded by john warnock when he left xerox with the intention of building a laser printer driven by the postscript language jobs convinced him to work with apple on building the laserwriter and sealed the deal shortly before the macintosh launched as a key part of the apple office concept introduced through 1985 's less popular lemmings super bowl ad the laserwriter was network eady out of the box courtesy of appletalk so system admins could string together a whole series of macs in a chain and share the printer between them thus reducing the average per eat cost of the device this made it immediately more competitive when stood beside its rivals and as infoworld reported in its issue of february 11 1985  pple claims a maximum of 31 users  an be attached to each laserwriter but its own departments at its cupertino california headquarters hook up 40 users per printer  so everything was in place on the hardware side what was missing  nbsp o far  nbsp as the software paul brainerd who is credited with inventing the term  esktop publishing  heard of apple  intention to build a laser printer and realised that the mac  graphical interface and the printer  high quality output were missing the one crucial part that would help both of them fly the intermediary application thus he founded aldus and began work on pagemaker the process took 16 months to complete and when it shipped in july 1985 for  95 pagemaker proved to be the piece that completed the dtp jigsaw the publishing industry was about to undergo a revolution the like of which it wouldn  see again until we all started reading online although it was later available on windows and vax terminals pagemaker started out on the mac and firmly established the platform as the first choice for digital creative work  nbsp hich is perhaps why it  favoured by so many designers today it  hard to believe in an age where we e used to 27in or larger displays that the macintosh 's 9in screen with a resolution smaller than the pixel count of an ios app icon was ever considered a viable environment for laying out graphically ich documents but it was by march 1987 less than two years from launch pagemaker 's annual sales had reached  8 m  nbsp n increase of 100 over the previous year according to funding universe  pagemaker versus quarkxpress but good things don  last forever and eventually pagemaker lost a lot of its sales to

in the us were being laid out using xpress  ncluding forbes itself  adobe and aldus merged in 1994 retained the adobe brand and transitioned products away from the aldus moniker it was a very logical pairing when you consider that pagemaker was conceived to take advantage of the graphics capabilities of an apple laser printer which in turn were served up by an adobe oded control language quark was going from strength to strength at the time of the merger and four years later – in summer 1998 – quark chief executive fred ebrahimi in forbes ' words 'announced his intention to buy adobe systems of san jose… a public company with three times quark 's revenues ' quark versus indesign of course the acquisition didn 't go ahead and what followed is now a familiar story to anyone in publishing adobe was already working on indesign under the codename k2 using code that had come across with the aldus merger indesign shipped in 1999 and after a few years of indesign and pagemaker running side by side the latter was retired pagemaker 's last major release was version 7 which shipped in 2001 and ran on both windows and os 9 or os x although only in classic mode on the latter it 's no doubt still in use on some computers and lives on in the shape of the archived pages on adobe 's site here  indesign was out in the wild by then and adobe was keen to push users down a more professional path we think that 's a shame as there 's still space in the market for a tool like pagemaker to act as an entry ramp to indesign further down the line business users may now turn to pages with its accomplished layout tools and help from dynamic guides but a fully ledged consumer and small business riendly tool like pagemaker would still find a home in many an open lan workspace jump to top of article jobs vs sculley it  all been good news so far in our story of apple  founding and early development we e still in the mid ighties the company is still young but going from strength to strength and it  offering up some serious competition for its larger longer stablished rivals few would have guessed that trouble was just around the corner to explain what happened next we need to step back a few months and look at the company structure steve jobs may have been apple  most public face and the co ounder of the company but he wasn  its ceo in the mid 980s he hadn  yet turned 30 and many on the board considered him too inexperienced for the role so they first hired michael scott and later mark markkula who had retired at 32 on the back of stock options he  acquired at fairchild semiconductor and intel markkula was one of apple  initial investors but he didn  want to run the company long term when he announced his desire to head back to retirement the company set out to find a replacement it settled on john sculley whom jobs famously lured to apple from pepsi by asking  o you want to sell sugared water for the rest of your life or do you want to come with me and change the world? walter isaacson in his biography of steve jobs quotes one of sculley  reminiscences   was taken by this young impetuous genius and thought it would be fun to get to know him a little better. that  exactly what he did and during the honeymoon period everything seemed to be going swimmingly as michael moritz writes in return to the little kingdom  t apple sculley was greeted like an archangel and for a time could do no wrong he and jobs were quoted as saying that they could finish each others sentences. their management styles were wildly different though and it  perhaps inevitable that this led to some conflicts between the two men sculley didn  like the way that jobs treated other staff members and the two came to blows over more practical matters including the pricing of the macintosh from the moment of its inception the macintosh was always supposed to be a computer for the rest of us keenly priced so that it would sell in large numbers the aim was to put out a  000 machine but over the years of gestation – as the project became more ambitious – this almost doubled shortly before its launch it was slated to go on sale at   95 but sculley could see that even this wasn  enough and he decreed that it would have to be hiked by another  00 jobs disagreed but sculley prevailed and the macintosh 128k hit the shelves at   95 that was just the start of the friction between the two men which wasn  helped by a downturn in the company  fortunes sales of the macintosh started to tail off the lisa was discontinued and jobs didn  hide the fact that his initial respect for sculley had cooled the board urged sculley to reign him in that  exactly what he did but not until march 1985  nbsp ust shy of two years after arriving at the company sculley visited jobs in his office and told him that he was taking away his responsibility for running the macintosh team talking to the bbc in 2012  sculley explained what went on inside the company at the time  hen the macintosh office  pple  office ide computing environment including networked macintosh computers file server and a laser printer was introduced in 1985 and failed steve went into a very deep funk he was depressed and he and i had a major disagreement where he wanted to cut the price of the macintosh and i wanted to focus on the apple ii because we were a public company we had to have the profits of the apple ii and we couldn  afford to cut the price of the macintosh because we needed the profits from the apple ii to show our earnings  nbsp ot just to cover the mac  problems that  what led to the disagreement and the showdown between me and steve and eventually the board investigated it and agreed that my position was the one they wanted to support  but jobs wasn  ready to go without a fight sculley had to leave the country on business that may and jobs saw this as the perfect opportunity to wrest back control of the company he confided in the senior members of his own team which at the time included jean ouis gassée who was being lined up to take over from jobs on the macintosh team gassée told sculley what was happening and sculley cancelled his trip the following morning sculley confronted jobs in front of the whole board asking if the rumours were true jobs said they were and sculley once again asked the board to choose between the two of them – bsp im or jobs again they sided with sculley and jobs fate was sealed jobs leaves apple scully reorganised the company installed gassée at the head of the computer division and made jobs apple  chairman that might sound like a plum job – indeed a promotion – but in reality it was a largely ceremonial role that took the co ounder away from the day o ay running of the company this wasn  jobs style he felt the need to move on and do something else and a few months later that  what he did he resigned from apple and founded next a company that would design and build high end workstations for use in academia taking several key apple staff with him if this had happened in the 2000s when apple was riding high on the back of the ipod and iphone and was prepping the world for the launch of the ipad it could have had catastrophic consequences in the 1980s though the outcome was somewhat different dewitt robbeloth editor of ii computing magazine wrote in the october 1985 issue   ost industry savants agree the move was good for apple or even crucial why there were serious differences between the two about what apple products should be like how they should be marketed and how the company should be run  so sculley was in control and could run apple as he saw fit now bsp e l see exactly where that takes the company over the following months read next 12 apple execs you need to know jean ouis gassée takes over from steve jobs the most recent stop of our tour through the history of apple saw jobs leave the company after falling out with the board it wasn  entirely unexpected  and the news wasn  greeted with the same kind of dread as the announcement of his cancer many years later indeed wall street responded positively to jobs departure and the price of apple stock went up jean ouis gassée who had been apple  director of european operations since 1981 was appointed by ceo john sculley to take over from jobs and head up macintosh development fewer positions could have been more prestigious in a company that owed its very existence to that single iconic product line  particularly at a time when the company  focus and ethos was about to undergo a significant change apple post obs  he first time in the months leading up to his departure jobs had been focused on consumer riendly price points initially wanting to sell the macintosh for   00 or less into as many homes and businesses as possible in the event that never came to fruition as the final spec simply couldn  be built marketed and shipped at that price while still turning a profit however with jobs now busy elsewhere the board was free to re hink what apple was about and the kind of machines it would produce it was already appealing to creative business users thanks to the prevalence of macs in design and layout offices so logically enough it made the decision to target the high nd market with more powerful and thus more expensive macs although the company would sell fewer units each one should  in theory  nbsp eliver similar or higher profits the policy had its own nickname  5 or die  which was a nod to gassée  dictat that the macintosh ii should deliver at least 55 profit per machine perhaps explains why it was so expensive a basic system with a 20mb hard drive  nsufficient to hold an average photoshop file today started at  500 but bumping up the spec with a colour display more memory and larger hard drive could easily see the price double when stood against their pc counterparts then apple  new computers looked pretty expensive but they had several benefits that kept their users loyal – in particular the user interface it  important to remember that although windows may be ubiquitous today that wasn  always the case when the macintosh ii first appeared in 1987 windows was less than two years old still at version 1 4 and still an add n to dos rather than a full lown stand lone operating system once the designers of the mid 980s had got used to working visually they didn  want to go back to using a text ased computer so until windows hit the big time which happened with windows 3 at the end of the 1980s apple had the graphical market pretty much to itself apple gets colourful the machintosh ii ships with a colour display this would be enough to encourage complacency in some companies but not apple which continued to innovate in a way that would at least partially justify the high prices the machintosh ii for instance wasn  simply a spec oost of the original macintosh it looked completely different being housed in a horizontal case that the end user  r an engineer could open themselves to upgrade the memory drives and so on this was a major break from apple  established way of doing things where all previous computers with the exception of the build t ourself apple i had been shipped in closed boxes largely because jobs saw this as a way of making them more friendly and less threatening it was also the first macintosh to ship with a colour display and although it  difficult to imagine what a difference that would make today we only need to think back to early mono ipods and compare them to the ipod touch to understand the impact it must have had aside from heading up the development of conventional computers gassée also oversaw a lot of apple  behind he cenes development where designers were dreaming up new products that would one day drive the company to new heights two of the fruits of those labours the newton messagepad and the emate were particularly prescient as they pointed towards apple  later dominance of lightweight computing through the ipad and iphone but they didn  see the light of day before gassée  own departure from apple his tenure ran from 1981 until the end of the decade which was the point the focus on highly riced premium products started to falter ibm clones were getting cheaper and with the uptake of windows and inexpensive desktop publishing applications even some of apple  most loyal customers were tempted to jump ship what gassée did after apple the fourth quarter of 1989 marked the first time apple had seen a drop in sales the stock market got edgy apple  shares lost a fifth of its value and despite having once been tipped to one day head up the company gassée left the following year like jobs he went on to found another radical computer company – in this case be incorporated which developed the beos operating system as we l see in a later episode his work with beos would come close to bringing gassée back to the company for now though apple was focused on trying to win back some of the less wealthy customers by introducing a range of lower riced computers including the macintosh classic  mhz processor integrated mono display  99  macintosh lc  6mhz processor pizza box case colour capable the initials stood for lc but it cost  99 without a display  and macintosh iisi  0mhz processor large desktop case  999 without a display  today amongst other things gassée writes a blog here  nbsp unsurprisingly after so many years of waiting apple customers lapped up these new affordable machines and the company enjoyed a revival indeed by returning to basics almost literally apple was back on the up and about to wow the world with two of its most radical products ever as we l discover below jump to top of article apple  decline and ibm and microsoft  rise so steve jobs has gone and so has jean ouis gassée his successor as head of product development all in all the future isn 't looking so bright for apple at this point in its story despite initially being quite successful in chasing high profits with wide margins its market is starting to shrink and with it so did its retained income for the first time in the company 's history its year nd results showed its cash balances to be rising more slowly than they had the year before that wasn  its only problem though ibm had been out arning apple since the mid 980s when it established itself as the dominant force in office computing there was little indicating that this would change any time soon and to make matters worse apple 's key differentiator was about to be dealt a close o ethal blow microsoft was gearing up for windows 3  nbsp  direct competitor to the all raphical os system windows had been a slow burner until this point versions 1 and 2 came and went without bothering apple to much but windows 3 was a different story entirely the interface was more accomplished which for the first time supported 256 colours and it was more stable thanks to a new protected mode the graphical design language had been implemented from end to end with icons in place of program names in windows explorer its equivalent of the mac 's finder it could also run ms dos applications in a windows window so it felt more like the unified graphical os experience we know today  nbsp nd which was already a hallmark of apple 's gui underpinnings in short more people than ever before could happily spend their whole day in a windows environment which would have left them asking why they would buy a mac when there were so many pcs to choose from apple  bsp uadra and performa apple needed to up its game which it did by developing a whole new line of computers that we now might think of as classics of their time chiefly the quadra and performa but also the less well nown centris  hich as its name suggested sat at the 'centre ' of the line p  the performa line was in effect a case of apple rebranding its existing stock but bundling them with consumer riendly software like clarisworks and grolier encyclopedia so they would appeal to the home user the idea was to make them a viable stock item for department stores and other lifestyle outlets as to date apple  computers had only been available through authorised dealers and mail order  here was no such thing as the apple store back then  it was a sound theory and one that would have exposed the apple brand to a whole new audience but it didn  quite work as might have been expected in part that was because the enormous range of slightly different models was confusing  nbsp o confusing that apple went to the expense of producing a 30 inute infomercial showing a regular family choosing and buying a performa you can still find it online in six linked parts  it  unlike the kind of short and snappy advertising we e used to these days devoid of catchphrases and it spends a lot of time explaining not only why a performa is the right choice but also why windows is difficult to use it  hypnotic  nbsp nd it  hard to argue with its message too if you can devote enough time to it macintosh performa 6300 you can see a full list of the various performa machines and the original macintosh models from which each one was derived on wikipedia  and its clear from the minor differentiations between them that some of the simplicity on which apple was founded  nbsp nd to which it has since returned  nbsp ad by now been lost having so many computers to market and ship also meant the company had to try and predict which machines would sell best and build enough of each one to satisfy demand that didn  always happen and with windows ased computers approaching ubiquity apple realised it was going to have to team up with one of its long time rivals ibm if it was going to take a lead jump to top of article the aim alliance apple teams up with ibm and motorola together apple ibm and motorola founded the aim alliance in october 1991  he name is their initials  to build a brand new hardware and software combo called prep  nbsp he powerpc reference platform this ambitious project would go head to head against the existing windows  intel hegemony by running a next eneration operating system  rom apple on top of brand new risc ased processors  rom ibm and motorola  apple 's nascent operating system was codenamed pink and not without good reason much of the code was rolled into copland the aborted os that we 've encountered once before in our tour of the archives and it came about following an extraordinary meeting in which all of the company 's future projects were written down on blue and pink card those that made it onto blue paper were comparatively easy and could be implemented in the short term those written on pink would require more effort and a longer timeframe the next generation os was naturally noted on one of the latter aim alliance 's plans never came to fruition on the software side and there were problems on the hardware front too when you bring together three notable players like apple ibm and motorola it 's to be expected that they 'd each have their own ideas about the best way to do things so perhaps it was inevitable that their differing views on the reference platform 's make p didn 't always align if it had worked out prep might indeed have changed the face of computing it didn 't of course but it did result in a change of direction for apple prep  legacy was the powerpc processor which went on to form the bedrock of its computer line p for years to come the powerpc years if you bought a new apple computer any time between 1994 and 2006 you l have taken home a powerpc ased device the genesis of which we explored above the fruit of a productive collaboration between apple ibm  es ibm and motorola  the aim alliance  nbsp t was for a while one of the most advanced platforms on the planet indeed it proved versatile enough to sit at the heart of everything from the lowly ibook right up to the mightiest enterprise ocused xserve powerpc 601 processor prototype the name is an acronym for performance optimization with enhanced risc erformance computing and its core technology was based on ibm  power instruction set so even though it was an innovation of the early 990s it wasn  an entirely alien platform for developers coding for the mac this helped make powerpc a viable alternative to the x86 ased processors being shipped by intel and amd which were then dominating the computing market even microsoft shipped a version of windows nt for powerpc before scaling back to focus solely on x86 and later freescale the first powerpc ased macintosh  re ac was 1994  power macintosh 6100 which as its name suggests was based on the 601 processor running at 60mhz and developed using code that was already familiar to engineers from both motorola and apple as the quadra  successor it was the first machine able to run mac os 9 which would likely have been a big enough sales point on its own however perhaps hedging its bets  latform transitions are nerve racking projects after all it also released a dos ompatible version which instead used an intel 486 processor and allowed windows and mac os to be run simultaneously effectively doing what vmware fusion and parallels desktop do today and virtualpc did in the powerpc line  latter years power macintosh 6100 the 6100 was released in concert with the beefier power macintosh 7100 which had been developed under the internal codename  arl sagan  it was a convoluted choice based on the belief that the computer was so brilliant it would make the company  illions and billions  which just happened to be the name of a book written by astronomer carl sagan who used to stress the letter   when saying the word  illions so people wouldn  confuse it with millions although it was never used to market the 7100 sagan claimed that customers might have considered the codename which was revealed in a magazine to imply that he endorsed the product he wrote to the magazine asking them to make it clear that he did not at which point apple  development team re amed the computer bha for butt ead astronomer sagan sued for libel and lost with the court ruling that  ne does not seriously attack the expertise of a scientist using the undefined phrase  utt ead   carl sagan eventually the two parties settled out of court at which point the 7100 was again renamed this time to law or lawyers are wimps the powerpc line enjoyed a good innings but by the middle of this century  first decade  e e jumping ahead a bit here to tie p the powerpc story  fractures were starting to appear in the alliance and the platform wasn  evolving quickly enough to keep consumers happy apple  high nd notebook the powerbook was starting to look a little underpowered and in an effort to push the processor in the power mac g5 beyond its native rating it produced three special editions that employed a sophisticated water cooling system that allowed it to overclock the processor without it overheating powerpc 970fx processor as used in one of the last power mac g5s those in the know began talking about parallel teams working inside apple hq on a version of os x that would run on intel processors the gossip was never confirmed but the fact it had even been mooted meant jobs 2005 announcement that the company would shift its entire line p to intel hardware was less of a shock than it might have been jumping ship just four years after the introduction of os x would have been too big a move for many ceos who might have been afraid that they  frighten away their customers as macworld wrote  t was a big gamble for a company that had relied on powerpc processors since 1994 but jobs argued that it was a move apple had to make to keep its computers ahead of the competition  s we look ahead  we may have great products right now and we e got some great powerpc product  still yet to come  jobs told the audience at the 2005 worldwide developers conference  but we can envision some amazing products we want to build for you and we don  know how to build them with the future powerpc road map  you might have expected developers to be up in arms after decades of honing their code to run smoothly on powerpc architecture they  have to throw it away and start from scratch but apple gave them a crutch at least in the interim rather than cut off support for legacy code from day one it built a runtime layer into os x tiger  0   called rosetta a name inspired by the rosetta stone the multi ingual engravings on which were the key to understanding hieroglyphics this interim layer intercepted power g3 g4 and altivec instructions and converted them on the fly to intel ompatible code there would have been a slight performance hit naturally but it was an impressive stopgap and one that apple maintained until it shipped lion  lthough snow leopard  the last iteration to support it and the first for which there was no powerpc release didn  install it by default  nbsp ou had to add it manually  powerpc lives on not only in the countless legacy macs that are still putting in good service but in consumer devices like the wii u playstation 3 and xbox 360 as well as in faceless computing applications where it  a popular choice for embedded processing of course during the 12 years of powerpc  dominance many other things were going on behind the scenes apple was working on the newton messagepad chipping away at a revolutionary operating system that never shipped and as a result bought steve jobs company next and with it jobs himself ensuring apple  survival jump to top of article apple and microsoft if it was a soap opera apple and microsoft  on ff relationship would put eastenders to shame today you  never guess there had ever been anything wrong and that  probably down to the fact that their relationship has never been more symbiotic idc figures released in bsp ummer 2015 showed mac sales to have climbed by 16 over the previous quarter at the same time though the overall pc market for machines running windows had dipped by 11   so with ever more of microsoft  revenue coming from office 365 it needs to push its subscription ased productivity service onto as many platforms as it can  nbsp ncluding android ios and of course the mac apple on the other hand needs office it has its own productivity apps in the shape of pages numbers and keynote but word excel and powerpoint remain more or less industry standards so if it 's going to be taken seriously in the business world apple needs microsoft office onboard so a peace has broken out  nbsp nd a long asting one at that which despite some sniping from either side stretches right back to jobs nbsp eturn to apple after his time at next we 'll come to that later but suffice it to say at this point that it shouldn  really surprise us the rivalry between the two camps often seems overblown microsoft developed many of the office apps for the mac before porting them to the pc and in the early days at least bill gates had good things to say about the company  o create a new standard it takes something that  not just a little bit different  he said in 1984  t takes something that  really new and really captures people  imagination and the macintosh  nbsp f all the machines i e seen  nbsp s the only one that meets that standard  that  pretty flattering but there  a saying about flattery imitation is its sincerest form apple apparently didn  see it that way when microsoft in apple  eyes went on to imitate its products a little too faithfully as we already know apple had been inspired by certain elements of an operating system it saw at xerox parc when it was developing the macintosh and lisa xerox  implementation used the desktop metaphor now familiar to os x windows and many linux users and when microsoft was developing windows 1  apple licensed some of its fundamentals to the company that jobs latterly took to calling  ur friends up north  that was fine when windows was just starting out but when version 2 hit the shelves with significant amendments apple was no longer so happy to share and share alike microsoft windows 1  most significantly microsoft had implemented one of the features of which apple was proudest the ability to overlap live application windows this is more complex as it sounds as it requires some advanced calculations to determine which parts sit beneath others not to mention how they should behave when repositioned however apple 's primary argument was that taken as a whole the generic look and feel of a graphical operating system  nbsp uch as its resizable movable windows title bars and so on  nbsp hould be subject to copyright protection rather than each of the specific parts looking back on it now it 's easy to see that this would be akin to ford copyrighting the idea of a car rather than a specific engine implementation or means of heating the windscreen but back then the gui was such an innovation that you can understand why apple would have wanted to protect it the court didn  buy into the idea of look and feel and asked apple to come back with a more specific complaint highlighting the parts of its own operating system that it believed microsoft had stolen so apple made a list of 189 points of which all but 10 were thrown out by the court as having been covered by the licensing agreement drawn up between the two parties with respect to windows 1  that left apple with just 10 points on which to build its case microsoft windows 2  however over at parc xerox could see that if apple won it might be able to claim the rights to those elements itself even though they  been dreamed up following on from jobs et al  tour of its labs xerox had no choice but to mount a claim itself against apple stating that the operating environments on the macintosh and lisa infringed its own copyrights ultimately xerox  act of self efence was unnecessary as the court ruled against apple deciding that while their specific implementation was important the general idea of using office ike elements such as folders and a desktop was too generic to protect apple appealed but to no avail however it did at least avoid losing to xerox as the palo alto company 's claim was thrown out of course apple and microsoft patched things up eventually and for that we should all be grateful if they hadn  it  possible there might be no mac today why because when he came back to apple and set about returning it to greatness jobs realised that he couldn  do it alone he might have a streamlined hardware line p waiting in the wings headlined by the groundbreaking imac but he knew that without the software to back them up they 'd never attain their full potential business users wouldn  switch to a platform that didn  support industry standard document formats like those produced by word excel and powerpoint and that remains true today while home users and small teams will be happy to use pages numbers and keynote it departments  nbsp articularly those in mixed latform offices  nbsp ften still rely on microsoft office formats so steve jobs put in a personal call to bill gates  who was then microsoft  ceo and convinced him to keep developing office for mac for at least the next five years gates did just that and at the same time microsoft bought  50m worth of non oting apple stock thereby securing its future in return apple unseated netscape as the mac  default browser and installed internet explorer in its place which was actively developed right up until 2003 when in the face rumours that apple was working on its own browser in house  nbsp afari  nbsp icrosoft scaled back its work on ie for mac to the point where today it no longer runs on os x apple in the 1990s apple was a very different company in the 1990s to the one we know today it had a lot of products and a lot of stock but not enough customers there  only so long a company can survive like that looking back on it now you  be forgiven for thinking it was losing its way alongside its computer range it was producing digital cameras  here it was ahead of most of the big ame players that now dominate photography  video consoles tv appliances and cd players it had also invested heavily in the newton platform to produce the messagepad and emate lines in many respects to use a well orn cliche it was running before it could walk almost all of these products have equivalents in apple  current line p where they form the basis of the iphone camera apple tv ipad and so on but in the 1990s there was no way to link them all together they were to all intents and purposes disparate and largely disconnected products there was no overarching storyline to what apple was producing the way there is now where the mac apple watch apple tv and ios devices can all share data courtesy of icloud to make matters worse the decision to license a lot of its technologies was only making it harder for apple to succeed in each marketplace as it was enabling its rivals to produce cheaper cloned versions of its top ine products even the newton platform wasn  immune with motorola siemens and sharp among others using the operating system and hardware spec to build their own products cloning remains a contentious issue in apple history aside from being bad news from apple  in ouse hardware development many consumers would say it was actually good for the end user as it encouraged competition and as a result lowered prices that brought more people to the platform than apple would have managed to attract on its own
