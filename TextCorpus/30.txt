inc was founded on april 1 1976 by college dropouts steve jobs and steve wozniak who brought to the new company a vision of changing the way people viewed computers jobs and wozniak wanted to make computers small enough for people to have them in their homes or offices simply put they wanted a computer that was user riendly 1 jobs and wozniak started out building the apple i in jobs garage and sold them without a monitor keyboard or casing  hich they decided to add on in 1977  the apple ii revolutionized the computer industry with the introduction of the first ver color graphics  sales jumped from    million in 1978 to  17 million in 1980 the year apple went public 2 wozniak left apple in 1983 due to a diminishing interest in the day o ay running of apple computers jobs then hired pepsico  john sculley to be president however this move backfired and after much controversy with sculley jobs left in 1985 and went on to new and bigger things he founded his own company next software and he also bought pixar from george lucas which would later become a huge success in computer animation of such movies as toy story  a bug  life  monsters inc  and finding nemo  3 through the rest of the 1980s apple was still doing well and in 1990 it posted its highest profits yet this was however mostly due to the plans that jobs had already set in motion before he left most notably his deal with a tiny company by the name of adobe creator of the adobe portable document format  df  together the two companies created the phenomenon known as desktop publishing 4 back in 1985 sculley turned down an appeal from microsoft founder bill gates to license its software this decision would later come back to haunt him because microsoft whose windows operating system  s featured a graphical interface similar to apple  became their toughest competition in the late 1980s and throughout the 1990s 5 over the course of a few years apple  market share suffered slowly after its peak in 1990 and by 1996 experts believed the company to be doomed it was not until 1997 when apple was desperately in need of an operating system that it bought out next software  obs company and the board of directors decided to ask for some help from an old friend steve jobs jobs became an interim ceo or iceo as he called himself  obs was not officially the ceo until 2000  jobs decided to make some changes around apple he forged an alliance with microsoft to create a mac version of its popular office software 6 not long after this decision was the turning point for the company jobs revamped the computers and introduced the ibook   personal laptop  he also started branching out into mp3 players  pod and media player software  tunes  this was jobs best move yet while computers are still an important part of apple its music related products    ipod and itunes have become the company  most profitable sector apple has also recently released the iphone a cellular phone and the apple tv
