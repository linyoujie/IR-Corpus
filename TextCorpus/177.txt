are weak nuclear forces strong nuclear forces electromagnetism and gravity of these gravity is perhaps the most mysterious while it has been understood for some time how this law of physics operates on the macro cale – governing our solar system galaxies and superclusters – how it interacts with the three other fundamental forces remains a mystery naturally human beings have had a basic understanding of this force since time immemorial and when it comes to our modern understanding of gravity credit is owed to one man who deciphered its properties and how it governs all things great and small – sir isaac newton  thanks to this 17th century english physicist and mathematician our understanding of the universe and the laws that govern it would forever be changed while we are all familiar with the iconic image of a man sitting beneath an apple tree and having one fall on his head newton 's theories on gravity also represented a culmination of years worth of research which in turn was based on centuries of accumulated knowledge he would present these theories in his magnum opus philosophiae naturalis principia mathematica  mathematical principles of natural philosophy "  which was first published in 1687 in this volume newton laid out what would come to be known as his three laws of motion  which were derived from johannes kepler 's laws of planetary motion and his own mathematical description of gravity  these laws would lay the foundation of classical mechanics and would remain unchallenged for centuries – until the 20th century and the emergence of einstein 's theory of relativity  newton 's own copy of his principia with hand ritten corrections for the second edition credit trinity cambridge ndrew dunn physics by 17th century the 17th century was a very auspicious time for the sciences with major breakthroughs occurring in the fields of mathematics physics astronomy biology and chemistry some of the greatest developments in the period include the development of the heliocentric model of the solar system by nicolaus copernicus  the pioneering work with telescopes and observational astronomy by galileo galilei  and the development of modern optics it was also during this period that johannes kepler developed his laws of planetary motion formulated between 1609 and 1619 these laws described the motion of the then nown planets  mercury  venus  earth  mars  jupiter  and saturn  around the sun they stated that planets move around the sun in ellipses with the sun at one focus the line connecting the sun to a planet sweeps equal areas in equal times the square of the orbital period of a planet is proportional to the cube  rd power of the mean distance from the sun in  r in other words–of the "semi ajor axis " of the ellipse half the sum of smallest and greatest distance from the sun  these laws resolved the remaining mathematical issues raised by copernicus ' heliocentric model thus removing all doubt that it was the correct model of the universe working from these sir isaac newton began considering gravitation and its effect on the orbits of planets a comparison of the geocentric and heliocentric models of the universe credit history csb du newton 's three laws in 1678 newton suffered a complete nervous breakdown due to overwork and a feud with fellow astronomer robert hooke for the next few years he withdrew from correspondence with other scientists except where they initiated it and renewed his interest in mechanics and astronomy in the winter of 1680 1 the appearance of a comet about which he corresponded with john flamsteed  ngland 's astronomer royal also renewed his interest in astronomy after reviewing kepler 's laws of motion newton developed a mathematical proof that the elliptical form of planetary orbits would result from a centripetal force inversely proportional to the square of the radius vector newton communicated these results to edmond halley  iscoverer of "haley 's comet " and to the royal society in his de motu corporum in gyrum this tract published in 1684 contained the seed of what newton would expand to form his magnum opus the philosophiae naturalis principia mathematica  this treatise which was published in july of 1687 contained newton 's three laws of motion which stated that when viewed in an inertial reference frame an object either remains at rest or continues to move at a constant velocity unless acted upon by an external force the vector sum of the external forces  f on an object is equal to the mass  m of that object multiplied by the acceleration vector  a of the object in mathematical form this is expressed as f m a when one body exerts a force on a second body the second body simultaneously exerts a force equal in magnitude and opposite in direction on the first body together these laws described the relationship between any object the forces acting upon it and the resulting motion laying the foundation for classical mechanics the laws also allowed newton to calculate the mass of each planet the flattening of the earth at the poles and the bulge at the equator and how the gravitational pull of the sun and moon create the earth 's tides in the same work newton presented a calculus ike method of geometrical analysis using 'first and last ratios ' worked out the speed of sound in air  ased on boyle 's law   accounted for the procession of the equinoxes  hich he showed were a result of the moon 's gravitational attraction to the earth  initiated the gravitational study of the irregularities in the motion of the moon provided a theory for the determination of the orbits of comets and much more newton and the "apple incident " the story of newton coming up with his theory of universal gravitation as a result of an apple falling on his head has become a staple of popular culture and while it has often been argued that the story is apocryphal and newton did not devise his theory at any one moment newton himself told the story many times and claimed that the incident had inspired him in addition the writing 's of william stukeley – an english clergyman antiquarian and fellow member of the royal society – have confirmed the story but rather than the comical representation of the apple striking newton on the head stukeley described in his memoirs of sir isaac newton 's life  752 a conversation in which newton described pondering the nature of gravity while watching an apple fall "…we went into the garden  mp drank thea under the shade of some appletrees only he  mp my self amidst other discourse he told me he was just in the same situation as when formerly the notion of gravitation came into his mind "why should that apple always descend perpendicularly to the ground  thought he to himself occasion 'd by the fall of an apple… " john conduitt newton 's assistant at the royal mint  ho eventually married his niece  also described hearing the story in his own account of newton 's life according to conduitt the incident took place in 1666 when newton was traveling to meet his mother in lincolnshire while meandering in the garden he contemplated how gravity 's influence extended far beyond earth responsible for the falling of apple as well as the moon 's orbit similarly voltaire wrote n his essay on epic poetry  727 that newton had first thought of the system of gravitation while walking in his garden and watching an apple fall from a tree this is consistent with newton 's notes from the 1660s which show that he was grappling with the idea of how terrestrial gravity extends in an inverse quare proportion to the moon sapling of the reputed original tree that inspired sir isaac newton to consider gravitation credit wikipedia commons oodog however it would take him two more decades to fully develop his theories to the point that he was able to offer mathematical proofs as demonstrated in the principia  once that was complete he deduced that the same force that makes an object fall to the ground was responsible for other orbital motions hence he named it "universal gravitation " various trees are claimed to be "the " apple tree which newton describes the king 's school grantham  claims their school purchased the original tree uprooted it and transported it to the headmaster 's garden some years later however the national trust which holds the woolsthorpe manor   here newton grew up in trust claims that the tree still resides in their garden a descendant of the original tree can be seen growing outside the main gate of trinity college cambridge below the room newton lived in when he studied there newton 's work would have a profound effect on the sciences with its principles remaining canon for the following 200 years it also informed the concept of universal gravitation which became the mainstay of modern astronomy and would not be revised until the 20th century – with the discovery of quantum mechanics and einstein 's theory of general relativity  we have written many interesting articles about gravity here at universe today here is who was sir isaac newton  who was galileo galilei  what is the force of gravity

operates on the macro cale – governing our solar system galaxies and superclusters – how it interacts with the three other fundamental forces remains a mystery 8221   really    we understand how gravity works on the macro cale  why all the discussion of  8220 ark matter 8221 i wonder also  8220 he fundamental forces interacting 8221  8230 how do fundamental forces interact  torbjorn larsson om says april 28 2016 at 6 1 pm it is precisely because we understand gravity why we understand the dark matter  nd dark energy that shows up in the cosmic microwave background spectra and in its effects on gravitational lensing  espectively cosmological expansion behavior   https  alileospendulum rg 012 2 7 he enome f he niverse  fundamental forces interact at the quantum level such that the quantum vacuum of quantum field theory comprise  ll interactions when a particle physicist calculates the interactions of a particle  nd its field  he sums up the feynman diagram interactions from all other particles  https  rofmattstrassler om rticles nd osts article hysics asics irtual articles hat re hey  now you can either appeal to the so called core theory where you have the standard model for particles combined with general relativity  lso called the semiclassical approximation  in which case gravity affects particles through spacectime or you can quantize gravity as a field too with a graviton and do the quantum vacuum stuff both those approximations break down when the strenngth of gravity becomes large matt williams says april 29 2016 at 12 1 am it seems you beat me to it sir well argued and sourced 🙂 caw says april 29 2016 at 8 6 am so do the fields themselves interact or are we talking about their combined effects on  8220 articles 8221  do we believe that  ven at the quantum level that changes in one fundamental force can effect changes in the field of another fundamental force  ans particles  if so do we expect  hen we get a little smarter to be able to effect gravitational fields via electromagnetic forces matt williams says april 28 2016 at 8 9 pm relativity was able to account for the behavior of star system galaxies superclusters and is part of what gave rise to the theory of dark matter so yes and the three fundamental forces of electromagnetism and strong and weak nuclar forces interact in ways explained through quantum theory how these interact with gravity remains a mystery and finding the answer will provide us with a theory of everything coacervatedroplet says april 28 2016 at 5 0 pm bravo a refreshing read 8230 s usual more please what drove john flamsteed to be so meticulous in his master work how did fred hoyle rise across the english social strata i know dribs and drabs of the greats perhaps you will flesh them out

star had dimmed continuing to steadily fade for months it 's a variable star and it 's known to get dimmer and brighter but the big surprise is that it 's still continuing to dim recently passing magnitude 1 6 and still getting dimmer this is unprecedented in the decades that astronomers have been watching the star the world 's biggest telescopes are on the case and the european southern
