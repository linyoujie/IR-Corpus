carrying all before them western europe had been decisively conquered and there were few signs of any serious resistance to german rule the failure of the italians to establish mussolini  much aunted new roman empire in the mediterranean had been made good by german intervention german forces had overrun greece and subjugated yugoslavia in north africa rommel  brilliant generalship was pushing the british and allied forces eastwards towards egypt and threatening the suez canal above all the invasion of the soviet union in june 1941 had reaped stunning rewards with leningrad  he present ay st petersburg besieged by german and finnish troops smolensk and kiev taken and millions of red army troops killed or captured in a series of vast encircling operations that brought the german armed forces within reach of moscow surrounded by a girdle of allies from vichy france and finland to romania and hungary and with the more or less benevolent neutrality of countries such as sweden and switzerland posing no serious threat the greater german reich seemed to be unstoppable in its drive for supremacy in europe yet in retrospect this proved to be the high point of german success the fundamental problem facing hitler was that germany simply did not have the resources to fight on so many different fronts at the same time leading economic managers such as fritz todt had already begun to realise this when todt was killed in a plane clash on 8 february 1942 his place as armaments minister was taken by hitler  personal architect the young albert speer imbued with an unquestioning faith in hitler and his will to win speer restructured and rationalised the arms production system building on reforms already begun by todt his methods helped increase dramatically the number of planes and tanks manufactured in german plants and boosted the supply of ammunition to the troops us military might but by the end of 1941 the reich had to contend not only with the arms production of the british empire and the soviet union but also with the rapidly growing military might of the world  economic superpower the united states throughout 1941 rightly fearing the consequences of total german domination of europe for america  position in the world us president franklin d roosevelt had begun supplying britain with growing bsp uantities of arms and equipment guaranteed through a system of  end ease and formalised in august by the atlantic charter when the japanese bombed pearl harbor in early december hitler saw the opportunity to attack american convoys without inhibition and declared war on the us in the belief that roosevelt would be too preoccupied with countering the japanese advance in the pacific to trouble overmuch with events in europe yet such was the economic might of the americans that they could pour increasing resources into the conflict in both theatres of war germany produced 15 00 new combat aircraft in 1942 26 00 in 1943 and 40 00 in 1944 in the us the figures were 48 00 86 00 and 114 00 respectively added to these were the aircraft produced in the soviet union – 37 00 in 1943 for example – and the uk 35 00 in 1943 and 47 00 in 1944 it was the same story with tanks where 6 00 made in germany each year had to face the same number produced annually in britain and the dominions and three times as many in the soviet union in 1943 the combined allied production of machine uns exceeded 1 million compared with germany  165 00 nor did germany  commandeering of the economies of other european countries do much to redress the balance the germans ruthless requisitioning of fuel industrial facilities and labour from france and other countries reduced the economies of the subjugated parts of europe to such a state that they were unable – and with their workers becoming ever more refractory unwilling – to contribute significantly to german war production above all the reich was short of fuel romania and hungary supplied a large proportion of germany  needs but this was not enough to satisfy the appetite of the wehrmacht  gas uzzling tanks and fighter planes rommel  eastward push across northern africa was designed not just to cut off britain  supply route through the suez canal but above all to break through to the middle east and gain control over the region  vast reserves of oil in mid 942 he captured the key seaport of tobruk but when he resumed his advance he was met with massive defensive positions prepared by the meticulous british general bernard montgomery at el alamein over 12 days he failed to break through the british lines and was forced into a headlong retreat across the desert to complete the rout the allies landed an expeditionary force further west in morocco and algeria a quarter of a million german and italian troops surrendered in may 1943 rommel had already returned to germany on sick leave  he war in north africa  he concluded bitterly  as decided by the weight of anglo merican material  if he had been provided with  ore motorised formations  and a more secure supply line he believed he could still have driven through to the oilfields of the middle east but it was not to be by the time of montgomery  victory it had become clear that the germans attempt to compensate for their lower levels of arms production by stopping american supplies and munitions from reaching britain across the atlantic had also failed in the course of 1942 a determined construction campaign increased the number of u oats active in the atlantic and the arctic from just over 20 to more than 100 in november 1942 alone they sank 860 00 tonnes of allied shipping aided by the germans ability to decipher british radio traffic while keeping their own secret battle of the atlantic but from december 1942 the british could decode german ciphers once more and steer their convoys away from the waiting wolf acks of u oats small aircraft carriers began to accompany allied convoys using spotter planes to locate the german submarines which had to spend most of their time on the surface in order to move with any reasonable speed and locate the enemy  ships by may 1943 the allies were building more ship tonnage than the germans were sinking while one u oat was being sunk by allied warships and planes on average every day on 24 may 1943 the commander of the u oat fleet admiral karl dönitz conceded defeat and moved his submarines out of the north atlantic the battle of the atlantic was over the most dramatic and most significant reversal of german fortunes came however on the eastern front the sheer scale of the conflict between the wehrmacht and the red army dwarfed anything seen anywhere else during the second world war from 22 june 1941 the day of the german invasion there was never a point at which less than two hirds of the german armed forces were engaged on the eastern front deaths on the eastern front numbered more than in all the other theatres of war put together including the pacific hitler had expected the soviet union which he regarded as an unstable state ruled by a clique of  ewish bolsheviks   bsp izarre idea given the fact that stalin himself was an antisemite  exploiting a vast mass of racially inferior and disorganised peasants to crumble as soon as it was attacked but it did not on the contrary stalin  patriotic appeals to his people helped rally them to fight in the  reat patriotic war  spurred on by horror at the murderous brutality of the german occupation more than three million soviet prisoners of war were deliberately left to die of starvation and disease in makeshift camps civilians were drafted into forced labour villages were burned to the ground towns reduced to rubble more than one million people died in the siege of leningrad but it did not fall soviet reserves of manpower and resources were seemingly inexhaustible in a vast effort major arms and munitions factories had been dismantled and transported to safety east of the urals here they began to pour out increasing quantities of military hardware including the terrifying  talin organ  the katyusha rocket auncher in the longer run the bsp ermans were unable to match any of this even if some of their hardware notably the tiger and panther tanks was better than anything the russians could produce they simply could not get them off the production lines in sufficient quantities to make a decisive difference war in the snow already in december 1941 japan  entry into the war and its consequent preoccupation with campaigns in the pacific allowed stalin to move large quantities of men and equipment to the west where they brought the german advance to a halt before moscow unprepared for a winter war poorly clad and exhausted from months of rapid advance and bitter fighting the german forces had to abandon the idea of taking the russian capital a whole string of generals succumbed to heart attacks or nervous exhaustion and were replaced hitler himself took over as commander n hief of the army hitler had already weakened the thrust towards moscow by diverting forces to take the grainfields of the ukraine and push on to the crimea for much of 1942 this tactic seemed to be succeeding german forces took the crimea and advanced towards the oilfields of the caucasus here again acquiring new supplies of fuel to replenish germany  dwindling stocks was the imperative but soviet generals had begun to learn how to co rdinate tanks infantry and air power and to avoid encirclement by tactical withdrawals german losses mounted the german forces were already dangerously short of reserves and supplies when they reached the city of stalingrad on the river volga in august 1942 three months later they had still not taken the city stalingrad became the object of a titanic struggle between the germans and the soviets less because of its strategic importance than because of its name when the germans moved bsp heir best troops into the city leaving the rear to be guarded by weaker romanian and italian forces the soviet generals saw their chance broke through the rearguard and surrounded the besieging forces short of fuel and ammunition the germans under general paulus were unable to break out as one airfield after another was captured by the red army supplies ran out and the german troops began to starve to death on 31 january 1943 refusing the invitation to commit suicide that came with hitler  gift of a field marshal  baton paulus surrendered some 235 00 german and allied troops were captured more than 200 00 had been killed it was the turning point of the war last great counter ttack from this moment on the german armies were more or less continuously in retreat on the eastern front the red army around stalingrad was threatening to cut off the german forces in the caucasus so they were forced to withdraw abandoning their attempt to secure the region  oil reserves in early july 1943 came the last great german counter ttack at kursk this was the greatest land battle in history involving more than four million troops 13 00 tanks and self ropelled guns and 12 00 combat aircraft warned of the attack in advance the red army had prepared defences in depth which the germans only managed partially to penetrate a bsp ragi omic incident happened when an advancing soviet tank force fell into its own side  defensive ditches nearly 200 tanks were wrecked or destroyed by the incredulous waffen s forces waiting for them on the other side the local party commissar nikita khrushchev covered up this disaster by persuading stalin that they had been destroyed in a huge battle that had eliminated more than 400 german tanks and won a heroic victory the legend of  he greatest tank battle in history was born in fact it was nothing of the kind so enormous were the russian reserves that the loss of the tanks made little difference in the end as fresh troops and armour were moved in to rescue the situation more than one million soldiers 3 00 tanks and self ropelled guns and nearly 4 00 combat aircraft entered the fray on the soviet side and began a series of successful counter ffensives the germans were forced to retreat the missing german tanks had not been destroyed they had been pulled out by hitler to deal with bsp  rapidly deteriorating situation in italy after the war german generals claimed bitterly they could have won at kursk had hitler not stopped the action in reality however the soviet superiority in men and resources was bsp verwhelming and the tanks really were needed in italy following their victory in north africa the allies had landed in sicily on 10 july 1943 to be greeted in palermo by italian citizens waving white flags a fortnight later reflecting the evaporation of italy  will to fight on the fascist grand coalition deposed mussolini and began to sue for peace on 3 september an armistice was signed and allied forces landed on the italian mainland german troops had already invaded from the north taking over the entire peninsula following the armistice they seized 650 00 italian soldiers and shipped them off to germany as forced labourers to join millions of others drafted in from poland and the soviet union to replace german workers sent to the front to replenish the wehrmacht  rapidly diminishing manpower in a daring commando raid on the alpine hotel where mussolini was being held prisoner ss paratroopers liberated the former dictator who was put in charge of a puppet regime based on the town of salò but as the allied armies made their way slowly northwards towards rome nothing could disguise the fact that germany  principal ally had now been defeated german morale these events had a devastating effect on german morale at home in particular the catastrophe of stalingrad began to convince many germans that the war could not be won worse was to come meeting at casablanca in january 1943 churchill and roosevelt decided on a sustained campaign of bombing german cities a series of massive raids on the industrial area of the ruhr followed backed up by the destruction of key dams by the famous  ouncing bombs on 16 may 1943 arms production was severely affected and in late july and early august 1943 the centre of hamburg was almost completely destroyed in a firestorm created by intensive incendiary bombing that killed up to 40 00 people injured a further 125 00 many of them seriously and made 900 00 homeless refugees from the devastated city spread a sense of shock and foreboding all across germany in hamburg itself anger at the nazis failure to defend the city led to crowds tearing party badges off officials coats amid cries of  urderer  the chief of staff of the german airforce committed suicide german air defences were still able to inflict serious losses on allied bombing expeditions but they were not strong enough to prevent the devastation continuing by the end of 1943 german forces were retreating all along the line in the east and in italy the spectacle of german defeat and the brutal requisitioning of millions of forced labourers from occupied countries fuelled the rise of resistance movements right across europe the reich had lost command of the skies and the seas ever more devastating bombing raids on a growing range of towns and cities were making people  lives unbearable ordinary germans knew by the end of 1943 that the war was lost terror began to replace commitment as a means of keeping people fighting on more than 20 00 german troops were executed by courts artial during the war for varieties of defeatism at home people faced a similar escalation of terror from the nazi party and the ss retreating into their private and family worlds they began to focus increasingly on simply staying alive and waiting for the end richard j evans is regius professor of modern history at cambridge university his trilogy on nazi germany the coming of the third reich the
