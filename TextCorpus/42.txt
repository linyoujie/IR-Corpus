and also while he was at it proved the earth wasn 't flat wrong wrong and wrong given that the european explorer has a u  federal holiday to his name — and is honored by holidays in other countries as well — let 's look at the disturbing truth about the fearless but brutal columbus  e didn 't prove that the earth is round  kids in school have long been taught that when columbus set sail in 1492 to find a new route to the east indies it was feared he would fall off the edge of the earth because people then thought the planet was flat nope  as early as the sixth century b   pythagoras — later followed by aristotle and euclid — wrote about earth as a sphere and historians say there is no doubt that the educated in columbus 's day knew quite well that the earth was round columbus in fact owned a copy of ptolemy 's  geography  written at the height of the roman empire 1 00 years before chris columbus set sail several books published in europe between 1200 and 1500 discussed the earth 's shape including "the sphere  written in the early 1200s which was required reading in european universities in the 1300s and beyond  the big question for columbus it turns out was not the shape of the earth but the size of the ocean he was planning to cross ad ad  the famous names of the ships he took on his famous  1492 trip across the atlantic ocean   the   niña    pinta   and santa maria probably weren 't really named niña   pinta  and  santa maria the  santa maria  was also known at the time as  la gallega  meaning  the galician   the  niña  is now believed to be a nickname for a ship originally called the  santa clara  and the  pinta  was probably also a nickname though the ship 's real name isn 't clear  olumbus didn 't "discover " america — he never set foot in north america during four separate trips that started with the one in 1492 columbus landed on various caribbean islands  that are now the bahamas as well as the island later called hispaniola he also explored the central and south american coasts but he didn 't reach north america which of course was already inhabited by native americans and he never thought he had found a new continent you may also remember that it is believed that norse explorer leif erikson  reached canada perhaps 500 years before columbus was born and there are some who believe that phoenician sailors crossed the atlantic much earlier than that ad ad and here 's something he did do that you may not know  columbus was a brutal viceroy and governor of the caribbean islands on which he did land he committed atrocities against native peoples on the islands and decimated their populations while he also terrorized spanish colonists according to the biography "columbus " by laurence bergreen why do we celebrate columbus day the first columbus day celebration recorded in the united states was in new york on october 12th 1792 held  to honor italian merican heritage president franklin delano roosevelt in 1937 proclaimed october 12th to be columbus day a national holiday in 1971 the holiday date was changed to the second monday in october ad for various reasons many places have changed the name of the holiday berkeley california replaced columbus day with indigenous peoples day in 1992 to honor the original inhabitants of the islands where columbus landed  in 1989 south dakota started calling the holiday native american day  alabama celebrates a combination of columbus day and american indian heritage day and hawaii calls it discovery day other countries also celebrate columbus with different holidays for example in the bahamas it is called discovery day and as día de la hispanidad and fiesta nacional in spain 0 comments home home share share share on facebook email this link
