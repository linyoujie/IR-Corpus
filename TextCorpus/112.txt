managed to gain control again by using the re ntry system thrusters the event was the first serious emergency in space and although the mission ultimately ended safely the spacecraft was forced to splash down early because the re ntry system was already expended armstrong also narrowly avoided a nasty accident in may 1968 this time within earth  atmosphere  while flying the lunar landing research vehicle  dash a machine that could fly somewhat like a lunar module and simulate landings on the moon fuel for the attitude thrusters ran out and armstrong was forced to eject just seconds
