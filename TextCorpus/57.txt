ranz alt writes in archaeology of computers  dash reminiscences 945 7  communications of the acm july 1972 one of the peculiarities that distinguished eniac from all later computers wasthe way in which instructions were set up on the machine it was similar tothe plugboards of small punched ard machines but here we had about 40plugboards each several feet in size a number of wires had to be pluggedfor each single instruction of a problem thousands of them each time aproblem was to begin a run and this took several days to do and many moredays to check out when that was finally accomplished we would run theproblem as long as possible i  as long as we had input data beforechanging over to another problem typically changeovers occurred only onceevery few weeks image  103

2003  i was roaming around the links and sublinks in the eniac story and note withmuch interest that there were three or four castered twiddle boards  ortable function tables a b and c  where i had always assumed onlyone i note the almost complete absence of col then major simon and ofdick clippinger who should share with von neumann the credit for movingfrom plugging to twiddling for program insertion i was pleased to see short reference to the ibm i  units which show inyour and other copies of the most famous photo i wonder if john mcpherson knows how they weresold ented iven to the

wasn  intentional but the elision of all references to thebig punched card shop cunningham ran and to the two relay machines ibmbuilt certainly was those are what actually did firing tables fter desk calculators were overwhelmed and until the bell machinearrived and until eniac was moved in and later freed up now about the    dubious    above i don  think wallace eckert had any influence whatsoever on the designers of the eniac or the ascc certainly in the hundreds and hundreds of hours he and i talked aboutthose two machines he never mentioned such nor did frank hamilton whowas number two on the ascc ever hint at the latter a 1938 meeting between ascc  howard aiken and wallace eckert is wellknown bsp  9  gutzwiller bsp  90  says that prespereckert  mong other well nown

 omputers for a new job witha secret machine bartik jumped at the chance and was hired as one of theoriginal six programmers of eniac the first all lectronic programmablecomputer she joined frances

construction and its 18 00 vacuum tubetechnology uncertain the engineers had no time for programming manuals orclasses bartik and the other women taught themselves eniac  operation fromits logical and electrical block diagrams and then figured out how toprogram it they created their own flow charts programming sheets wrotethe program and placed it on the eniac using a challenging physicalinterface which had hundreds of wires and 3 00 switches it was anunforgettable wonderful experience on february 15 1946 the army revealed the existence of eniac to thepublic in a special ceremony the army introduced eniac and its hardwareinventors dr john mauchly and j presper eckert the presentation featuredits trajectory ballistics program operating at a speed thousands of timefaster than any prior calculations the eniac women  program workedperfectly  and conveyed the immense calculating power of eniac and itsability to tackle the millennium problems that had previously taken a man100 years to do it calculated the trajectory of a shell that took 30seconds to trace it but it took eniac only 20 seconds to calculate it  aster than a speeding bullet indeed the army never introduced the eniac women no one gave them any credit or discussed their critical part in the eventthat day their faces but not their names became part of the beautifulpress pictures of the eniac for forty years their roles and theirpioneering work were forgotten and their story lost to history the eniacwomen  story was discovered by kathy kleiman in 1985 bartik will discusswhat it means to be overlooked despite
