 alan turing  a short biography my publications alan turing  8212 a short biography by andrew hodges home page  site map  contact and faq this short biography based on the entry for the written in 1995 for the oxford dictionary of scientific biography  gives an overview of alan turing  life and work it can be read as s summary of my book alan turing the enigma  1 the origins of alan turing alan mathison turing was born on 23 june 1912 the second and last child  fter his brother john of julius mathison and ethel sara turing the unusual name of turing placed him in a distinctive family tree of english gentry far from rich but determinedly upper iddle lass in the peculiar sense of the english class system his father julius had entered the indian civil service serving in the madras presidency and had there met and married ethel sara stoney she was the daughter of the chief engineer of the madras railways who came from an anglo rish family of somewhat similar social status although conceived in british india most likely in the town of chatrapur alan turing was born in a nursing home in paddington london in four inadequate words alan turing appears now as the founder of computer science the originator of the dominant technology of the late twentieth century but these words were not spoken in his own lifetime and he may yet be seen in a different light in the future they are also words very remote from the circumstances of his birth and infancy the name of turing was best known for the work of julius brother h d turing on fly fishing and had no connection with the scientific or academic worlds the name of stoney however was notable for a remote relative the irish physicist george johnstone stoney  826 911  today best known for his identification of the natural units of physical quantities possibly the engineering base of his mother  family with its respect for applied science had some influence but if so it was subordinated to the demands of class church and empire certainly the elder brother john f turing who became a london solicitor showed no sign of it alan turing  story was not one of family or tradition but of an isolated and autonomous mind alan turing shared with his brother a childhood rigidly determined by the demands of class and the exile in india of his parents until his father  retirement from india in 1926 alan turing and his elder brother john were fostered in various english homes where nothing encouraged expression originality or discovery science for him was an extra urricular passion first shown in primitive chemistry experiments but he was given and read later commenting on its seminal influence a popular book called natural wonders every child should know his boyhood scientific interests were a trial to his mother whose perpetual terror was that he would not be acceptable to the english public school at twelve he expressed his conscious fascination with using  he thing that is commonest in nature and with the least waste of energy, presentiment of a life seeking freshly minted answers to fundamental questions despite this he was successfully entered for sherborne school the headmaster soon reported  f he is to be solely a scientific specialist he is wasting his time at a public school  the assessment of his establishment was almost correct 2 matter and spirit turing  private notes on the theory of relativity showed a degree evel appreciation yet he was almost prevented from taking the school certificate lest he shame the school with failure but it appears that the stimulus for effective communication and competition came only from contact with another very able youth a year ahead of him at sherborne to whom alan turing found himself powerfully attracted in 1928 he christopher morcom gave turing a vital period of intellectual companionship  8212 which ended with morcom  sudden death in february 1930 turing  conviction that he must now do what morcom could not apparently sustained him through a long crisis for three years at least as we know from his letters to morcom  mother his thoughts turned to the question of how the human mind and christopher  mind in particular was embodied in matter and whether accordingly it could be released from matter by death this question led him deeper into the area of twentieth century physics first helped by a s eddington  book the nature of the physical world wondering whether quantum echanical theory affected the traditional problem of mind and matter as an undergraduate at king  college cambridge from 1931 he entered a world more encouraging to free anging thought his 1932 reading of the then new work of von neumann on the logical foundations of quantum mechanics helped the transition from emotional to rigorous intellectual enquiry at the same time this was when his homosexuality became a definitive part of his identity the special ambience of king  college gave him a first real home his association with the so alled anti ar movement of 1933 did not develop into marxism nor into the pacifism of his friend and occasional lover james atkins then a fellow undergraduate mathematician later musician he was closer in thought to the liberal eft economists j m keynes and a c pigou his relaxations were found not in the literary circles generally associated with the king  college homosexual milieu but in rowing running and later in sailing a small boat turing  progress seemed assured a distinguished degree in 1934 followed by a fellowship of king  college in 1935 and a smith  prize in 1936 for work on probability theory and he might then have seemed on course for a successful career as a mildly eccentric king  don engaged in pure mathematics his uniqueness of mind however drove him in a direction none could have foreseen by 1933 turing had already introduced himself to russell and whitehead  principia mathematica and so to the then arcane area of mathematical logic bertrand russell had thought of logic as a solid foundation for mathematical truth but many questions had since been raised about how truth could be captured by any formalism in particular in 1931 g uml el had shattered russell  picture by showing the incompleteness of mathematics the existence of true statements about numbers which could not be proved by the formal application of set rules of deduction in 1935 turing learnt from the lecture course of the cambridge topologist m h a newman that a further question posed by hilbert still lay open it was the question of decidability the entscheidungsproblem could there exist at least in principle a definite method or process by which it could be decided whether any given mathematical assertion was provable to answer such a question needed a definition of  ethod which would be not only precise but compelling this is what turing supplied he analysed what could be achieved by a person performing a methodical process and seizing on the idea of something done  echanically  expressed the analysis in terms of a theoretical machine able to perform certain precisely defined elementary operations on symbols on paper tape he presented convincing arguments that the scope of such a machine was sufficient to encompass everything that would count as a  efinite method. daringly he included an argument based on the transitions between  tates of mind of a human being performing a mental process 3 the turing machine this triple correspondence between logical instructions the action of the mind and a machine which could in principle be embodied in a practical physical form was turing  definitive contribution having made this novel definition of what should count as a  efinite method  8212 in modern language an algorithm  8212 it was not too hard to answer hilbert  question in the negative no such decision procedure exists in april 1936 he showed his result to newman but at the same moment the parallel conclusion of the american logician alonzo church became known and turing was robbed of the full reward for his originality his paper on computable numbers with an application to the entscheidungsproblem had to refer to church  work and was delayed until august 1936 however it was seen at the time that turing  approach was original and different church relied upon an assumption internal to mathematics rather than appealing to operations that could actually be done by real things or people in the physical world subsequently the concept of the turing machine has become the foundation of the modern theory of computation and computability turing worked in isolation from the powerful school of logical theory centred on church at princeton university and his work emerged as that of a complete outsider one can only speculate but it looks as if turing found in the concept of the turing machine something that would satisfy the fascination with the problem of mind that christopher morcom had sparked his total originality lay in seeing the relevance of mathematical logic to a problem originally seen as one of physics in this paper as in so many aspects of his life turing made a bridge between the logical and the physical worlds thought and action which crossed conventional boundaries his work introduced a concept of immense practical significance the idea of the universal turing machine the concept of  he turing machine is like that of  he formula or  he equation  there is an infinity of possible turing machines each corresponding to a different  efinite method or algorithm but imagine as turing did each particular algorithm written out as a set of instructions in a standard form then the work of interpreting the instructions and carrying them out is itself a mechanical process and so can itself be embodied in a particular turing machine namely the universal turing machine a universal turing machine can be made do what any other particular turing machine would do by supplying it with the standard form describing that turing machine one machine for all possible tasks it is hard now not to think of a turing machine as a computer program and the mechanical task of interpreting and obeying the program as what the computer itself does thus the universal turing machine embodies the essential principle of the computer a single machine which can be turned to any well efined task by being supplied with the appropriate program additionally the abstract universal turing machine naturally exploits what was later seen as the  tored program concept essential to the modern computer it embodies the crucial twentieth entury insight that symbols representing instructions are no different in kind from symbols representing numbers but computers in this modern sense did not exist in 1936 turing created these concepts out of his mathematical imagination only nine years later would electronic technology be tried and tested sufficiently to make it practical to transfer the logic of his ideas into actual engineering in the meanwhile the idea lived only in his mind in common with other outstanding young scientists turing spent two years at princeton university enrolled as a graduate student he arrived in september 1936 on computable numbers  was published at the very end of 1936 and attracted some attention by the time he left the idea had come to the attention of the leading hungarian merican mathematician john von neumann but turing certainly did not shoot to fame he worked on on algebra and number theory on showing that his definition of computability coincided with that of church and on an extension of his ideas  rdinal logics which provided a ph  thesis the work on  rdinal logics  probably his most difficult and deepest mathematical work wasan attempt to bring some kind of order to the realm of the uncomputable this also was connected to the question of the nature of mind as turing  interpretation of his ideas suggested that human  ntuition could correspond to uncomputable steps in an argument but turing never pursued this line of development after 1938 instead he was increasingly preoccupied with more immediate problems which demanded logical skills true to the concreteness of the turing machine he also spent time at princeton making a cipher machine based on using electromagnetic relays to multiply binary numbers even then he saw a link from  seless logic to practical computation although not one of the political intellectuals of the 1930s turing followed current events and was influenced in studying ciphers by the prospect of war with germany 4 the second world war in 1938 turing was offered a temporary post at princeton by von neumann but instead returned to cambridge he had no university lectureship in the year 1938  he lived on his king  college fellowship as logician and number theorist unusually for a mathematician he joined in wittgenstein  classes on the philosophy of mathematics unusually again he engineered gear heel parts for a special machine to calculate the riemann zeta unction publicly he sponsored the entry into britain of a young german jewish refugee secretly he worked part ime for the british cryptanalytic department the so alled government code and cypher school his appointment marked the first scientific input into a hitherto arts ased department that revolution was caused by the failure of pre cientific methods to penetrate the mechanical enigma cipher used by germany no significant progress was made however until the gift of vital ideas and information in july 1939 from poland where mathematicians had been employed on the problem much earlier upon british declaration of war on 3 september turing took up full ime work at the wartime cryptanalytic headquarters bletchley park the polish work was limited as it depended upon the very particular way the germans had been using the enigma one of their ideas was embodied in a machine called a bomba the way forward lay in turing  generalisation of the polish bombe into a far more powerful device capable of breaking any enigma message where a small portion of plaintext could be guessed correctly another cambridge mathematican w g welchman made an important contribution but the critical factor was turing  brilliant mechanisation of subtle logical deductions from late 1940 onwards the turing elchman bombe made reading of luftwaffe signals routine in contrast the more complex enigma methods used in german naval communications were generally regarded as unbreakable happy to work alone on a problem that defeated others turing cracked the system at the end of 1939 but it required the capture of further material by the navy and the development of sophisticated statistical processes before regular decryption could begin in mid 941 turing  section  ut 8  which deciphered naval and in particular u oat messages then became a key unit at bletchley park by the end of 1941 as the united states entered the war the battle of the atlantic was moving towards allied advantage on 1 february 1942 the atlantic u oat enigma machine was given an extra complication and this advantage was suddenly wiped out nothing could be decoded and catastrophe loomed besides illustrating the always razor dge state of the war of wits this crisis brought about a new ingredient in alan turing  experience electronic technology made its first appearance at bletchley park as telephone engineers were pressed into an effort to gain ever higher speeds of mechanical working as it turned out however the electronic engineers found themselves called upon to mechanize the breaking of the  ish material messages enciphered on the quite different system used for hitler  strategic communications here again turing  statistical ideas underlay the methods employed though it was m h a newman who played the organising role the conjunction of turing  thoughts with the practicality of large cale electronic machinery arising from this technical u oat enigma change came to have momentous consequences 5 emergence of the computer by 1942 alan turing was the genius loci at bletchley park famous as  rof  shabby nail itten tie ess sometimes halting in speech and awkward of manner the source of many hilarious anecdotes about bicycles gas masks and the home guard the foe of charlatans and status eekers relentless in long shift work with his colleagues mostly of student age to one of these joan clarke he proposed marriage and was gladly accepted but then he retracted telling her of his homosexuality turing crossed the atlantic in november 1942 for highest evel liaison not only on the desperate u oat enigma crisis but on the electronic encipherment of speech signals between roosevelt and churchill before his return in march 1943 logical weaknesses in the changed u oat system had been brilliantly detected and u oat enigma decryption was effectively restored for the rest of the war with the battle of the atlantic regained for the allies crisis resolved chess champion c h o  alexander hitherto turing  deputy took charge of hut 8 turing became an all urpose consultant to the by now vast bletchley park operation as such he saw the  ish material cracked by the colossus machines brought into operation just before d ay demonstrating the feasibility of large cale digital electronic technology turing himself devoted much time to learning electronics ostensibly for creating his own elegant speech secrecy system which he effected with the aid of one assistant donald bayley at nearby hanslope park but he had another and more ambitious end in view in the last stage of the war  or his part in which he was awarded an obe he planned the embodiment of the universal turing machine in electronic form or in effect invented the digital computer in 1944 at the invasion of normandy that allied control of the atlantic allowed alan turing was almost uniquely in possession of three key ideas his own 1936 concept of the universal machine the potential speed and reliability of electronic technology the inefficiency in designing different machines for different logical processes combined these ideas provided the principle the practical means and the motivation for the modern computer a single machine capable of handling any programmed task he himself was as eager as anyone in the world to bring them together and was spurred even more by a fourth idea that the universal machine should be able to acquire and exhibit the faculties of the human mind even in 1944 he spoke to donald bayley of  uilding a brain  turing was captivated by the potential of the computer he had conceived although his 1936 work had shown the absolute limitations of the computable he had become fascinated by what turing machines could do rather than by what they could not he had long abandoned his youthful expectations of finding free will or free spirits through quantum mechanics his later thought was strongly determinist and atheistic in character and by the end of the second world war he had turned against the tentative idea that there were steps of  ntuition in human thought corresponding to uncomputable operations instead he held that the computer would offer unlimited scope for practical progress towards embodying intelligence in an artificial form for the second time he experienced being pre mpted by a parallel american publication in this case the edvac plan for an electronic computer with von neumann  name attached nonetheless this publication when it appeared in june 1945 worked in practice to turing  advantage american competition stimulating the national physical laboratory to plan a rival project to which he was appointed a senior principal scientific officer turing despised his nominal superior j womersley but at least initially this applied mathematician showed a rapid appreciation of the scope of turing  ideas and with a eye for acronyms steered turing  design towards formal approval in early 1946 as the automatic computing engine or ace 6 building a brain turing  detailed computer scheme was drawn up in a continuation of wartime spirit as a plan that could be effected immediately with the memory storage  umbersome acoustic delay lines as used in radar that was to hand turing knew that superior technology would soon transform design his emphasis was on speed in every sense and in the exploitation of the universal machine concept this meant in particular implementing arithmetical functions by programming rather than by building in electronic components a concept different from that of the american erived designs the hardware design was short erm but his prospectus for the use of the machine was visionary turing projected a computer able to switch at will from numerical work to algebra codebreaking file handling or chess laying methods for handling subroutines included a suggestion that the machine could expand its own programs from an abbreviated form ideas well ahead of contemporary american plans a later talk  ebruary 1947 depicted a national computer centre with remote terminals and the prospect of the machine taking over more and more of its own programming work in 1947 his abbreviated code instructions marked the beginning of programming languages but not a single component of the ace was assembled and turing found himself without any influence in the engineering of the project the lack of cooperation very different from the wartime spirit he found deeply frustrating from october 1947 the npl allowed or perhaps preferred that he should spend the academic year at cambridge rather than publish these fundamental principles of computing he spent his time on new study amidst the post ar renaissance of science not in mathematics or technology but in neurology and physiology out of this came a pioneering paper on what would now be called neural nets written to amplify his earlier suggestions that a sufficiently complex mechanical system could exhibit learning ability this was submitted to the npl as an internal report and never published in his lifetime meanwhile the npl made no advance with the construction of the ace and as turing  position fell back other computer projects at cambridge and manchester took the lead indeed it was newman who had been the first reader of on computable numbers and in charge of the electronic breaking of the  ish ciphers who was partly responsible for this on his 1945 appointment to the chair of pure mathematics at manchester university he had negotiated a large royal society grant for the construction of a computer newman strongly promoted turing  principle of the stored rogram computer but unlike turing intended no personal involvement with engineering he conveyed the basic principles to the leading radar engineer f c williams who had been attracted to manchester and the latter  brilliant innovation made possible a rapid success manchester in june 1948 had the world  first practical demonstration of turing  computer principle although losing in the race to implement a universal machine and slow to communicate or compete in the game of scientific priority turing ran very competitively in a literal sense after the war he developed his strength in cross ountry running with frequent long istance training and top ank competition in amateur athletics he would amaze his colleagues by running to scientific meetings beating the travellers by public transport and only an injury prevented his serious consideration for the british team in the 1948 olympic games the return to cambridge helped alan turing form an agreeable circle of lasting friendships particularly with robin gandy who began at this period to develop under turing  influence and would later inherit his mantle as a mathematical logician although never secretive about his sexuality he now became more deliberately outspoken and exuberant and all thoughts of comfort or conformity were now left behind a mathematics student at king  college neville johnson became a lover 7 turing at manchester in may 1948 newman offered turing the post as deputy director of the computing laboratory at manchester university turing accepted resigned from the npl and moved in october 1948 the meaningless title reflected turing  uncertain status he had no control over the project whose fate was in fact determined by its sudden necessity for the british atomic bomb project f c williams had in any case built his own empire and newman  original plans were largely swept aside but turing did have a clear role to play as the organiser of programming for the engineers electronics turing at manchester could perhaps have led the world in software development his partly explored ideas included the use of mathematical logic for program checking implementing church  logical calculus on the machine and other ideas which combined with his massive knowledge of combinatorial and statistical methods could have set the agenda in computer science for years ahead this however he failed to do his work on machine ode programming at manchester produced only as a working manual was limited in scope instead there followed a confused period in which turing hovered between new topics and old he revisited his 1939 calculation of the riemann zeta unction with the use of the prototype computer he pursued the question of computability within the algebra of group theory out of this confused era arose however the most lucid and far eaching expression of turing  philosophy of machine and mind the paper computing machinery and intelligence which appeared in the philosophical journal mind in 1950 this besides summarising the view he had developed since 1936 absorbed his first and experience and experiment with machinery the wit and drama of the turing test has proved a lasting stimulus to later thinkers and the paper a classic contribution to the philosophy and practice of artificial intelligence research but this was essentially the end of his investigation and despite this model of communication supported by his radio talks he had apparently no influence on the american foundation of artificial intelligence later in the 1950s at the same time in 1950 there emerged a clear direction for new thought rather than return to classical mathematics the novel potential of the computer still held his attention and he became a pioneer of its personal use for as he settled in manchester buying his own first house at outlying wilmslow he had an entirely fresh field in view it was what he described as the mathematical theory of morphogenesis the theory of growth and form in biology outwardly an extraordinary change of direction for him it was a return to a fundamental problem even in childhood he had been spotted and sketched  atching the daisies grow  from childhood natural wonders to d rcy thompson  on growth and form to a more recent interest in how brains grow new connections he had sustained an interest in the biological structures so easily taken for granted yet so complex and bizarre from the viewpoint of physics out of all the phenomena of life he fixed on the way asymmetry can arise out of initially symmetric conditions as first thing requiring explanation and his answer given without apparent reference to anyone else  work was that it could arise from the nonlinearity of the chemical equations of reaction and diffusion he modelled hypothetical chemical reactions on the circle and the plane and for the repetitive numerical simulation required to test his ideas became the first serious user of an electronic computer for mathematical research he was elected to fellowship of the royal society in july 1951 for the work done fifteen years before but equal originality was on the way his first successful work on the chemical basis of morphogenesis was submitted as a paper that november long overlooked it was a founding paper of modern non inear dynamical theory 8 alan turing  crisis alan turing was arrested and came to trial on 31 march 1952 after the police learned of his sexual relationship with a young manchester man he made no serious denial or defence instead telling everyone that he saw no wrong with his actions he was particularly concerned to be open about his sexuality even in the hard and unsympathetic atmosphere of manchester engineering rather than go to prison he accepted for the period of a year injections of oestrogen intended to neutralise his libido his work on the morphogenetic theory continued he developed his theory of pattern formation out of instability into the realm of spherical objects such as the radiolaria and also on the cylinder as a model of plant stems he set as a particular goal the explanation for the appearance of the fibonacci numbers in the leaf patterns of plants  8212 most noticeable in the close acked spirals of sunflower heads and fir cones besides this he refreshed his youthful interest in quantum physics studying the problem of wave unction reduction in quantum mechanics with a hint that he was considering a non inear mechanism for it he took a new interest in the representation of elementary particles by spinors and in relativity theory a factor in his life unknown to most around him was that he had also continued to work for gchq the post ar successor to bletchley park on the basis of a personal connection with alexander now its director but since 1948 the conditions of the cold war and the alliance with the united states meant that known homosexuals had become ineligible for security clearance turing now therefore excluded spoke bitterly of this to his onetime wartime colleague now mi6 engineer donald bayley but to no other personal friends state security also seems the likely cause of what he described as another intense crisis in march 1953 involving police searching for a visiting norwegian who had come to see him concern over the foreign contacts of one acquainted with state secrets was understandable and his holiday in greece in 1953 could not have been calculated to calm the nerves of security officers although unable to tell his friends about questions of official secrecy in other ways he actively sought much greater intimacy of expression with them and with a jungian therapist eccentric solitary gloomy vivacious resigned angry eager dissatisfied  8212 these had always been his ever arying characteristics and despite the strength that he showed the world in coping with outrageous fortune no ne could safely have predicted his future course he was found by his cleaner when she came in on 8 june 1954 he had died the day before of cyanide poisoning a half aten apple beside his bed his mother believed he had accidentally ingested cyanide from his fingers after an amateur chemistry experiment but it is more credible that he had successfully contrived his death to allow her alone to believe this the coroner  verdict was suicide  opy andrew hodges 1995 other on ine publications listing of all my publications quick links
