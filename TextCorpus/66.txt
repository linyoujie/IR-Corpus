wind experiment as part of apollo 11 with neil armstrong snapping the photograph nasa  apollo 11 in all of human history only 24 people have ever flown to the vicinity of the moon traveling hundreds of thousands of miles from earth to do so twelve of those people on six independent missions actually set foot on the lunar surface we e left flags photographs seismometers mirrors and even vehicles behind we e brought back rocks dirt and literal pieces of the moon upon our return to earth these monumental moments in history of landing on the moon in the late 1960s and early 1970s are not a part of the memories of the vast majority of people living today unsurprisingly some of them are skeptical that it ever happened thankfully in science we don  need to be there ourselves to have proof here are four different pieces of evidence we can point to that demonstrate the moon landings actually occurred this iconic image taken by neil armstrong shows buzz aldrin planting the us flag on the moon note     the presence of footprints in the foreground these  nd other astronaut footprints believe it or not are still visible today nasa  apollo 11 1  lunar footprints  amp bsp ere on earth footprints generally don  last very long wherever you leave your tracks you fully expect that whether it takes minutes days or weeks eventually the natural phenomena in the world will cover them up winds blowing along the sand dunes rains in the forest or plant and animal activity will eventually eliminate the evidence of your passing all of this happens for a variety of reasons which include the fact that the earth has an atmosphere that we have weather that we have liquid water at our surface and that we have living species on our world so if we walked on the moon we would expect those footprints to still be there on earth footprints or other markings on the surface are only temporary and are easily erased by     the winds rains and other surface activity that comes about on a world with an atmosphere oceans and life on the moon however those conditions are absent and any alterations to the surface even those made by humans some  0 years ago should persist greg prohl    byron jorjorian   without winds rains snows glaciers rockslides or any other means of moving and rearranging the particles on the surface of the moon any footprints that we left there should remain for an interminable length of time the only rearrangement of lunar sand and grains that we know of occurs when there are impacts on the moon which kick up dust which then can settle across the lunar surface sunlight striking these particles is inefficient the lunar atmosphere is only approximately one atom thick launch and lander activity isn  energetic enough to substantially alter the distribution of material on the moon if we ever landed and traveled on the moon the evidence should still be there nasa  lunar reconnaissance orbiter which has orbited and mapped the moon at the highest resolution ever returning hundreds of terabytes of data has something to say about that apollo 12 was the first precision landing of humans on the moon and we explored a much greater     amount of the lunar surface than during the first landing the dark grey markings on the surface are astronaut footprints which have stood the test of time on the moon as the processes that erase them on earth are absent on the moon nasa  lro  gsfc  asu the orbiter  narrow angle camera has photographed three of the landing sites apollo 12 14 and 17 to unprecedented precision and accuracy by going close to the lunar surface and photographing it with modern instruments from that low altitude they were able to achieve resolutions as low as 35 centimeters  bout 14 inches per pixel the apollo 12 image shows not only the physical landing site  arked  uot ntrepid descent stage uot on the image  but also the surveyor 3 probe that had been on the moon since 1967 visited by the apollo 12 astronauts two nd  alf years later there  the bright white  uot  uot shape near the alsep equipment label the  uot  uot is due to highly reflective power cables that run from the central station to two of its instruments and finally the dark paths that look like dried p canals those are astronaut footprints the apollo 14 landing site is still intact and our images of it in modern times still carry the     legacy of this nearly 0 ears ld event the lunar surface changes very slowly over time and the changes we made in 1971 are still perceptible virtually unchanged today nasa  lro  gsfc  asu the view of apollo 14 is less spectacular but perhaps even more famous you can still see the descent module and the alsep equipment but nothing else leaps out at you well except for the footpaths once again whose are they edgar mitchell and the famed alan shepard although we never found the golf balls that alan proclaimed went  uot iles and miles uot when he hit them with a 6 ron we can absolutely see the evidence of the astronauts presence left behind on the moon nearly 50 years later a photograph from lunar reconnaissance orbiter of the landing site of apollo 17 the tracks of the     lunar roving vehicle  rv can be clearly seen as can the vehicle itself nasa  lro  gsfc  asu apollo 17 where eugene  ene cernan and harrison  ack schmitt became the last men to walk on the moon paints a notably different picture at this high resolution yes there  still the descent module on the surface the alsep equipment and the footpaths but look closer there  also something marked  uot rv uot as well as a lighter set of two parallel tracks that run across the surface know what they are the lunar roving vehicle was included on the last three apollo missions and enabled the astronauts     to travel greater distances and explore more diverse regions of the moon than they were able to on foot alone the tracks of these vehicles are still present today and can be seen in data from the lunar reconnaissance orbiter nasa  jack schmitt the apollo lunar roving vehicle included on apollo 15 16 and 17 its tracks on the surface are distinctly different from human footprints and allowed the astronauts on those missions to achieve distances far greater than those reached on the earlier missions the tracks from apollo 17  lrv don  even come close to fitting in this image they extend for a total distance of over 22 miles reaching a maximum range of nearly five miles away from the landing site why what  this it  an image taken by bill anders of apollo 8 the first crewed mission to go to     the moon and orbit it this photo was taken as the capsule orbited the moon and earth appeared to rise over the horizon the spacecraft window can be seen in the foreground nasa  apollo 8 2  over 8 00 photos documenting our trips  amp bsp erhaps we all need a reminder of what the sacrifices were that went into our journey to the moon we accomplished the unthinkable by banding together to achieve a common goal and could mp bsp o it all once again nasa has mp bsp eleased all the photos of the twelve apollo missions that made it to space on a publicly available flickr photostream  sorted into a series of incredible albums by mission apollo 10 known as the  ress rehearsal for the moon landing was actually equipped with all the     apparatuses that would have allowed them to land on the lunar surface themselves they came closer to the moon than any previous crewed mission and paved the way for the actual moon landing which took place with apollo 11 in july of 1969 nasa  apollo 10 some of the greatest most eye pening photos stories and quotes came back from those trips including some from apollo 8  bill anders who took the famous  uot arthrise uot photos illustrated above anders described the journey to the moon as follows you could see the flames and the outer skin of the spacecraft glowing and burning baseball ize chunks flying off behind us it was an eerie feeling like being a gnat inside a blowtorch flame some of the deployed scientific equipment taken to the moon during the apollo 12 mission where the     installation and operation of this equipment was well ocumented both remotely and in situ by the astronauts who installed it nasa  apollo 12 3  scientific equipment we e installed on the moon  did you know that we mp bsp rought up a large amount of scientific equipment and

wind  spectra from the moon the lsm experiment to measure the lunar magnetic field the ldd to measure how lunar dust would settle on and pollute solar panels and many others that we have the data from these experiments and that the lunar retroreflectors are still in use today represent some pretty strong evidence that we did in fact land on the moon this image from january 31 1971 shows sunrise

a surprise when they did schmitt the lone civilian stronaut  nd only scientist to travel to the moon was often described as the most business ike of all the astronauts which is why it must have been such a shock to hear him exclaim the following oh hey wait a minute… there is orange soil it 's all over i stirred it up with my feet the dull grey lunar soil you 're used to seeing — that we 're all used to seeing — in one particular spot was only a very thin veneer covering a rich orange landscape beneath the orange soil at the lower right of the image really stands out when compared to the colorations     visible on the rest of the moon apollo 17 perhaps because they had a geoscientist as one of their moonwalkers was able to spot this geological oddity that taught us so much about the moon  origin and composition nasa  apollo 17 like any good scientist or any good explorer for that matter cernan and schmitt took pictures collected data and brought samples back to earth for further analysis what could cause orange soil on the moon perhaps the most featureless of all the large airless rocks in our solar system what the analysis back on earth revealed was fantastic this was volcanic glass what occurred was that molten lava from the interior of the moon erupted some 3 to 4 billion years ago up above the airless surface and into the vacuum of space as the lava became exposed to the vacuum it separated out into tiny fragments and froze forming tiny beads of volcanic glass in orange and black colors  he tin in some of the fragments is what gives the orange color  olivine inclusions found in lunar samples have a spectacularly high water concentration of 1 00     ppm this is remarkable because it  the same exact concentration as the water found in terrestrial  arth ased olivine inclusions pointing to a common origin for the earth and the moon e  hauri et al  science 2011 jul 8 33 039 213–5 in 2011 reanalysis of those samples found evidence that water was included in the volcanic eruption with concentrations of water in the glass beads that were formed 50 times as great as the expected dryness of the moon olivine inclusions showed water present in concentrations up to 1 00 parts er illion most remarkably the lunar samples we e found have indicated that earth and the moon have a common origin consistent with a giant impact that occurred only a few tens of millions of years into the birth of our solar system without direct samples obtained by the apollo missions and brought back to earth we never would have been able to draw such a startling but spectacular conclusion a nasa picture taken on may 5 1972 shows a close p view or  ug shot of apollo 16 lunar sample     no 68815 a dislodged fragment from a parent boulder a fillet oil sample was
