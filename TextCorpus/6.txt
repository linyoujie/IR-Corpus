logician and cryptographer Alan Turing was responsible for breaking the Nazi Enigma code during World War II His work gave the Allies the edge they needed to win the war in Europe and led to the creation of the computer On the PBS NewsHour tonight Jeffrey Brown interviews Benedict Cumberbatch about his role as Turing in"The Imitation Game  Turing took his own life in 1954 two years after being outed as gay Homosexuality was still a crime in Great Britain at the time and Turing was convicted of"indecency  He died from eating an apple laced with cyanide He was only 41 years old At the time of his death the public had no idea what he had contributed to the war effort Sixty years later Queen Elizabeth II officially pardoned Turing  Andrew Hodges  a mathematician at the Mathematical Institute at Oxford University wrote the biography"Alan Turing The Enigma"  which inspired the film We spoke with Hodges this week about some things many people don't know about Turing Photo by Fine Art Images eritage Images etty Images 1 He was an Olympic evel runner He participated in a few sports such as rowing but he loved running Turing had"a bit of a'smelly trainers' aspect" to his personality  Hodges said To work it into his day he often ran to the places he needed to go He used to run the 10 miles between the two places where he did most of his work the National Physical Laboratory and the electronics building on Dollis Hill beating colleagues who took public transportation to the office He joined running clubs becoming a competitive amateur and winning several races In 1948 his best marathon time was 2 hours 46 minutes 3 seconds  8212 only 11 minutes slower than the Olympic winning time that year When one of his running club members asked why he trained so vehemently he replied"I have such a stressful job that the only way I can get it out of my mind is by running hard  221 2 He embodied some values of the Hippie movement"He was a hippie before his time  Hodges said"He was very casual in those days and thought very scruffy  Had he lived a few decades later he would have worn t hirts and jeans every day Hodges added It wasn't uncommon to see Turing dressed rather shabbily with bitten nails and without a tie  he said With his youthful face he was often mistaken for an undergraduate even in his 30s He also shared the left eaning views of many of his Kings College compatriots who included economists John Maynard Keynes and Arthur Cecil Pigou Though Turing joined the Anti ar Movement in 1933 he never got deeply involved in politics But watching Hitler's rise to power in the late 1930s scared him Hodges said and it spurred his interest in cryptography which would later help Great Britain in the war 3 He got bad grades and frustrated his teachers Science was a considered a second lass pursuit in English public schools in the 1920s Hodges said Turing's passion for science embarrassed his mother who had hoped he would study the classics which was the most acceptable pursuit for gentlemen But he got bad to mediocre grades in school followed by many complaints from his teachers  His English teacher wrote  8220  can forgive his writing though it is the worst I have ever seen and I try to view tolerantly his unswerving inexactitude and slipshod dirty work inconsistent though such inexactitude is in a utilitarian but I cannot forgive the stupidity of his attitude towards sane discussion on the New Testament  221 His math and science grades weren't much better He was nearly stopped from taking the national School Certificate exams on the subject for fear he would fail Pilot ACE 1950 is one of Britain 8217  earliest stored program computers and the oldest complete general purpose electronic computer It was based on plans for a larger computer  he ACE designed by the mathematician Alan Turing between 1945 and 1947 Photo by SSPL etty Images 4 The father of the computer also dabbled in physics biology chemistry and neurology Turing's most notable work today is as a computer scientist In 1936 he developed the idea for the Universal Turing Machine the basis for the first computer And he developed a test for artificial intelligence in 1950 which is still used today But he also studied physics especially as a young man He read Einstein's theory of relativity as a teenager and immediately filled a notebook with his own thoughts and ideas on the subject He dabbled in quantum mechanics a new field at the time as well as biology chemistry and neurology after the war Much of this work was related to creating machines that could learn and"think" but some of it came out of simple curiosity about the world 5 He developed a new field of biology out of his fascination with daisies Even as a child Turing saw life through the eyes of a scientist Hodges said There is a famous sketch of Turing as a boy"watching the daisies grow" while the other children play field hockey That sketch would foreshadow Turing's ground reaking work in 1952 on morphogenesis which became a completely new field of mathematical biology  It was a mathematical explanation of how things grow  8212 a great mystery to science Hodges explained His work on the subject has been cited more than 8 00 times  The subject of one of his seminal papers on the topic was called"Outline of the Development of the Daisy  Sculpture of Alan Turing in slate at Bletchley Park Photo from Wikimedia Commons taken by Jon Callas 6 He stuttered when talking It is true that he had a bit of a stammer something dramatic portrayals of Turing have exaggerated Hodges said He"took his time finding the right words  he explained In his biography he notes that a BBC radio producer had called Turing a very difficult person to interview for that reason 7 He didn 8217  keep his sexuality a secret among friends The laws at the time prevented Turing from being openly gay but he never kept his sexuality secret either He was open with his social circles at Kings College in Cambridge which was"an oasis of acceptance" at the time Hodges said Many people would have clung to that oasis he said but Turing branched out to continue his work In 1952 he was arrested and charged with"indecency" after a brief relationship with another man Defiant he did not deny the charges"When he was arrested the first thing he said was he thought that this shouldn't be against the law  Hodges said"He gave a statement that was unapologetic that detailed what had happened  8 He refused to let a punishment of chemical castration stop him from working The punishment for homosexuality was chemical castration a series of hormone injections that left Turing impotent It also caused gynecomastia  giving him breasts But Turing refused to let the treatment sway him from his work keeping up his lively spirit"He dealt with it with as much humor and defiance as you could muster  Hodges said"To his close friends it was obvious it was traumatic But in no way did he just succumb and decline He really fought back  8230 by insisting on continuing work as if nothing had happened  He openly talked about the trial even in the"macho environment" of the computer lab He mocked the law's absurdity In defiance he traveled abroad to Norway and the Mediterranean where the gay rights movements were budding Homosexuality was considered a security risk at the time and the conviction cost Turing his security clearance That was a harsh blow and Hodges believes that when he was restricted from leaving the country anymore it ultimately led Turing to suicide"After he'd been revealed as gay in 1952 he couldn't do any more secret work  Hodges said"It would have been hard to accept that he was not trusted  Left Alan Turing and colleagues working on the Ferranti
