finally pin down how long a day on the gas giant lasts  mage © NASA PL altech pace Science Institute Set your timers for 10 hours 33 minutes and 38 seconds — scientists have finally figured out how long a day lasts on Saturn  cracking a lingering mystery about the ringed gas giant  That  according to newly published research that uses data gathered by NASA  Cassini mission before the spacecraft  destruction in September 2017 The new calculation shaves several minutes off previous estimates for a Saturn day which scientists have been making for decades based on data from the Cassini mission and its predecessor Voyager   he researchers used waves in the rings to peer into Saturn  interior and out popped this long ought fundamental characteristic of the planet And it  a really solid result  Cassini Project Scientist Linda Spilker said in a statement   he rings held the answer   In Photos Cassini Mission Ends with Epic Dive into Saturn  It may seem like it should be easy to measure the length of a day on a planet — just wait and watch the world spin But Saturn  precise day length has stumped scientists for decades Because the planet is a gas giant researchers can  watch steady landmarks through the clouds as they could with a rocky planet Scientists can also typically use the tilt of a planet  magnetic field to measure its day length But that didn  work for Saturn because the field aligns nearly perfectly with the planet  rotation axis stymying their calculations One scientist who has studied the planet  magnetic field said that the day ength uncertainty is   bit embarrassing  speaking in an interview with Space om about research published in October These challenges left scientists with rough estimates falling between 10 hours 36 minutes and 10 hours 48 minutes — not particularly satisfying The research published today took an entirely different approach — looking not to the planet itself but at its delicate rings  This idea was proposed in 1982 but not until the Cassini mission did scientists have the data to see if the technique would work The idea is that as Saturn spins its insides wiggle a little causing small changes in the planet  gravitational field Those small changes ripple out to the chunks of ice in the rings that decorate the gas giant causing small waves in the rings  articles throughout the rings can  help but feel these oscillations in the gravity field  lead author Christopher Mankovich a graduate student in astronomy at the University of California Santa Cruz said in a statement   t specific locations in the rings these oscillations catch ring particles at just the right time in their orbits to gradually build up energy and that energy gets carried away as an observable wave  So Mankovich and his colleagues studied those observable waves and used them to backtrack inward to the planet itself That  how the researchers came up with the measurement of 10 hours 33 minutes and 38 seconds It  still not set in stone — the error bars on that calculation stretch between a minute and 52 seconds longer and a minute and 19 seconds shorter But the new calculation  range beats a 12 inute window The research is described in a paper published yesterday  an 17 in The Astrophysical Journal Email Meghan Bartels at mbartels pace om or follow her  eghanbartels  Follow us  bsp  pacedotcom and bsp
