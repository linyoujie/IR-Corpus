abacus invented in themiddle east circa 500 bc that it remained the fastest form ofcalculator until the middle of the 17th century then in 1642 agedonly 18 french scientist and philosopher blaisepascal  623 dash 666 invented the first practical mechanical calculator  the pascaline to help his tax ollector father do hissums the machine had a series of interlocking cogs  gear wheels with teeth around theirouter edges that could add and subtract decimal numbers severaldecades later in 1671 german mathematician and philosopher gottfried wilhelm leibniz  646 dash 716 came up witha similar but more advanced machine instead of using cogs it had a tepped drum   cylinder with teeth of increasing length around itsedge  an innovation that survived in mechanical calculators for 300hundred years the leibniz machine could do much more than pascal  aswell as adding and subtracting it could multiply divide and work outsquare roots another pioneering feature was the first memory store or  egister  apart from developing one of the world  earliest mechanicalcalculators leibniz is remembered for another important contributionto computing he was the man who invented binary code a way ofrepresenting any decimal number using only the two digits zero and one lthough leibniz made no use of binary in his own calculator it setothers thinking in 1854 a little over a century after leibniz had died englishman george boole  815 dash 864 used the idea to invent anew branch of mathematics called boolean algebra   in modern computers inary code and boolean algebra allow computers to make simpledecisions by comparing long strings of zeros and ones but in the 19thcentury these ideas were still far ahead of their time it would takeanother 50 dash 00 years for mathematicians and computer scientists to figure out howto use them  ind out more in our articles about calculators and logic gates   artwork pascaline two details of blaise pascal  17th entury calculator left the  ser

notoriouslygrumpy english mathematician named charles babbage  791 dash 871  many regard babbage as the  ather of the computer ecause his machines had an input   way of feeding in numbers  amemory  omething to store these numbers while complex calculationswere taking place  a processor  he number runcher that carried outthe calculations  and an output   printing mechanism  212 he same basiccomponents shared by all modern computers during his lifetime babbagenever completed a single one of the hugely ambitious machines that hetried to build that was no surprise each of his programmable ngines was designed to use tens of thousands of precision adegears it was like a pocket watch scaled up to the size of a steamengine  a pascal or leibniz machine magnified a thousand old indimensions ambition and complexity for a time the britishgovernment financed babbage 8212 o the tune of  ound 7 00 then anenormous sum but when babbage pressed the government for more money tobuild an even more advanced machine they lost patience and pulled out abbage was more fortunate in receiving help from augustaada byron  815 dash 852  countess of lovelace daughter of thepoet lord byron an enthusiastic mathematician she helped to refinebabbage  ideas for making his machine programmable 8212 nd this is why sheis still sometimes referred to as the world  first computerprogrammer   little of babbage  work survived after his death butwhen by chance his notebooks were rediscovered in the 1930s computerscientists finally appreciated the brilliance of his ideas nfortunately by then most of these ideas had already been reinventedby others babbage had intended that his machine would take the drudgery out ofrepetitive calculations originally he imagined it would be used bythe army to compile the tables that helped their gunners to firecannons more accurately toward the end of the 19th century otherinventors were more successful in their effort to construct  ngines f calculation american statistician hermanhollerith  860 dash 929 built one of the world  first practicalcalculating machines which he called a tabulator to help compilecensus data then as now a census was taken each decade but by the1880s the population of the united states had grown so much throughimmigration that a full cale analysis of the data by hand was takingseven and a half years the statisticians soon figured out that iftrends continued they would run out of time to compile one censusbefore the next one fell due fortunately hollerith  tabulator was anamazing success it tallied the entire census in only six weeks andcompleted the full analysis in just two and a half years soonafterward hollerith realized his machine had other applications so heset up the tabulating machine company in 1896 to manufacture itcommercially a few years later it changed its name to thecomputing abulating ecording     company and then in 1924 cquired its present name international business machines  bm

cumbersomenames the new recording product integraph multiplier later he builta machine called the differential analyzer which used gears belts evers and shafts to represent numbers and carry out calculations in avery physical way like a gigantic mechanical slide rule bush ultimate calculator was an improved machine named the rockefellerdifferential analyzer assembled in 1935 from 320 km  00 miles ofwire and 150 electric motors  machineslike these were known as analog calculators 8212 nalog because they storednumbers in a physical form  s so many turns on a wheel or twists of abelt rather

turing  912 dash 954 wasa brilliant cambridge mathematician whose major contributions were to the theory of howcomputers processed information in 1936 at the age of just 23 turing wrotea groundbreaking mathematical paper called  n computable numbers with an application to the entscheidungsproblem in which he described a theoretical computer now known as aturing machine   simple information processor that works through a series of instructions eading data writing results and then moving on to the next instruction turing  ideas were hugely influential in the years that followed and many peopleregard him as the father of modern computing dash he 20th entury  equivalent of babbage although essentially a theoretician turing did get involved with real practical machinery nlike many mathematicians of his time during world war ii he played a pivotal role in the development of code reakingmachinery that itself played a key part in britain  wartime victory later he played a lesser rolein the creation of several large cale experimental computers includingace  utomatic computing engine  colossus and the manchester erranti mark i  escribed below today alan turing is best known for conceiving what  become known as the turing test a simpleway to find out whether a computer can be considered intelligent by seeing whether it cansustain a plausible conversation with a real human being the first modern computers the world war ii years were a crucial period in the history ofcomputing when powerful gargantuan computers began to appear justbefore the outbreak of the war in 1938 german engineer konrad zuse  910 dash 995 constructed his z1 theworld  first programmable binary computer in his parents livingroom   the following year american physicist johnatanasoff  903 dash 995 and his assistant electrical engineer clifford berry  918 dash 963  built a more elaboratebinary machine that they named the atanasoff berry computer  bc  itwas a great advance 8212 000 times more accurate than bush  differentialanalyzer these were the first machines that usedelectrical switches to store numbers when a switch was  ff  itstored the number zero flipped over to its other  n  position itstored the number one hundreds or thousands of switches could thusstore a great many binary digits  lthough binary is much lessefficient in this respect than decimal since it takes up to eightbinary digits to store a three igit decimal number  these machineswere digital computers unlike analog machines which stored numbersusing the positions of wheels and rods they stored numbers as digits the first large cale digital computer of this kind appeared in 1944at harvard university built by mathematician howardaiken  900 dash 973  sponsored by ibm it was variously known asthe harvard mark i or the ibm automatic sequence controlled calculator scc  a giant of a machine stretching 15m  0ft in length it waslike a huge mechanical calculator built into a

different ingermany when konrad zuse offered to build his z2 computer to help thearmy they couldn  see the need 8212 nd turned him down on the allied side great minds began to make great breakthroughs n 1943 a team of mathematicians based at bletchley park near london ngland  ncluding alan turing built a computer called colossus to help them crack secretgerman codes colossus was the first fully electronic computer insteadof relays it used a better form of switch known as a vacuum tube  lsoknown especially in britain as a valve  the vacuum tube each one aboutas big as a person  thumb and glowing red hot like a tiny electriclight bulb had been invented in 1906 by lee deforest  873 dash 961  who named it the audion thisbreakthrough earned de forest his nickname as  he father of radio because their first majoruse was in radio receivers  where they amplified weak incoming signalsso people could hear them more clearly   in computers such as the abcand colossus vacuum tubes found an alternative use as faster and morecompact switches just like the codes it was trying to crack colossus was top ecretand its existence wasn  confirmed until after the war ended as far asmost people were concerned vacuum tubes were pioneered by a morevisible computer that appeared in 1946 the electronic numericalintegrator and calculator  niac  the eniac  inventors twoscientists from the university of pennsylvania johnmauchly  907 dash 980 and j presper eckert  919 dash 995  were originally inspired by bush  differential analyzer ears later eckert recalled that eniac was the  escendant of dr bush machine  but the machine they constructed was far more ambitious itcontained nearly 18 00 vacuum tubes  ine times more than colossus was around 24 m  0 ft long and weighed almost 30 tons eniac isgenerally recognized as the world  first fully electronic eneral urpose digital computer colossus might have qualified forthis title too but it was designed purely for one job  ode reaking since it couldn  store a program it couldn  easily be reprogrammed to do other things eniac was just the beginning its two inventors formed the eckertmauchly computer corporation in the late 1940s working with abrilliant hungarian mathematician john von neumann  903 dash 957  who was based at princeton university they then designeda better machine called edvac  lectronic discrete variable automaticcomputer  in a key piece of work von neumann helped to define how themachine stored and processed its programs laying the foundations forhow all modern computers operate   after edvac eckert and mauchly developed univac 1  niversal automatic computer in 1951 they werehelped in this task by a young largely unknown american mathematicianand naval reserve named grace murray hopper  906 dash 992  who had originally been employed by howard aiken on theharvard mark i like herman hollerith  tabulator over 50 years before nivac 1 was used for processing data from the us census it was thenmanufactured for other users 8212 nd became the world  first large calecommercial computer machines like colossus the eniac and the harvard mark i competefor significance and recognition in the minds of computer historians hich one was truly the first great modern computer all of them andnone these 8212 nd several other important machines 8212 volved our idea ofthe modern electronic computer during the key period between the late1930s and the early 1950s among those other machines were pioneeringcomputers put together by english academics notably the manchester erranti mark i uilt at manchester university by frederic williams  911 dash 977 and thomas kilburn  921 dash 001 and the edsac  lectronic delay storage automatic calculator  built by maurice wilkes  913 dash 010 at cambridgeuniversity   the microelectronic revolution vacuum tubes were a considerable advance on relay switches butmachines like the eniac were notoriously unreliable the modern termfor a problem that holds up a computer program is a  ug  popularlegend has it that this word entered the vocabulary of computerprogrammers sometime in the 1950s when moths attracted by the glowinglights of vacuum tubes flew inside machines like the eniac caused ashort circuit and brought work to a juddering halt but there wereother problems with vacuum tubes too they consumed enormous amounts ofpower the eniac used about 2000 times as much electricity as a modernlaptop and they took up huge amounts of space military needs weredriving the development of machines like the eniac but the sheer sizeof vacuum tubes had now become a real problem abc had used 300 vacuumtubes colossus had 2000 and the eniac had 18 00 the eniac designers had boasted that its calculating speed was  t least 500times as great as that of any other existing computing machine  butdeveloping computers that were an order of magnitude more powerfulstill would have needed hundreds of thousands or even millions ofvacuum tubes 8212 hich would have been far too costly unwieldy andunreliable so a new technology was urgently required photo a typical transistor on an electronic circuit board the solution appeared in 1947 thanks to three physicists working atbell telephone laboratories  ell labs  johnbardeen  908 dash 991  walter brattain  902 dash 987  and william shockley  910 dash 989 ere then helping bell to develop new technology for the americanpublic telephone system so the electrical signals that carried phone calls could beamplified more easily and carried further shockley who was leading the team believedhe could use semiconductors  aterials such as germanium and siliconthat allow electricity to flow through them only when they e beentreated in special ways to make a better form of amplifier than the vacuum tube hen his early experiments failed he set bardeen and brattain to workon the task for him eventually in december 1947 they created a newform of amplifier that became known as the point ontact transistor ell labs credited bardeen and brattain with the transistor and awardedthem a patent this enraged shockley and prompted him to invent an evenbetter design the junction transistor which has formed the basis ofmost transistors ever since like vacuum tubes transistors could be used as amplifiers or asswitches but they had several major advantages they were a fractionthe size of vacuum tubes  ypically about as big as a pea  used nopower at all unless they were in operation and were virtually 100percent reliable the transistor was one of the most importantbreakthroughs in the history of computing and it earned its inventorsthe world  greatest science prize the 1956 nobel prize in physics  y that time however the three men had already gone theirseparate ways john bardeen had begun pioneering research into superconductivity  which would earn him a second nobel prize in 1972 alter brattain moved to another part of bell labs william shockley decided to stick with the transistor eventuallyforming his own corporation to develop it further his decision wouldhave extraordinary consequences for the computer industry with a smallamount of capital shockley set about hiring the best brains he couldfind in american universities including young electrical engineer robert noyce  927 dash 990 andresearch chemist gordon moore  929 dash  t wasn  long before shockley  idiosyncratic and bullying managementstyle upset his workers in 1956 eight of them 8212 ncluding noyce andmoore 8212 eft shockley transistor to found a company of their own airchild semiconductor just down the road thus began the growth of ilicon valley  the part of california centered on palo alto wheremany of the world  leading computer and electronics companies havebeen based ever since   it was in fairchild  california building that the next breakthroughoccurred 8212 lthough somewhat curiously it also happened at exactly thesame time in the dallas laboratories of texas instruments in dallas ayoung engineer from kansas named jack kilby  923 dash 005 was considering how to improve the transistor althoughtransistors were a great advance on vacuum tubes one key problemremained machines that used thousands of transistors still had to behand wired to connect all these components together that process waslaborious costly and error prone wouldn  it be better kilbyreflected if many transistors could be made in a single package thisprompted him to invent the  onolithic integrated circuit  c  acollection of transistors and other components that could bemanufactured all at once in a block on the surface of asemiconductor kilby  invention was another step forward but it alsohad a drawback the components in his integrated circuit still had tobe connected by hand while kilby was making his breakthrough indallas unknown to him robert noyce was perfecting almost exactly thesame idea at fairchild in california noyce went one better however e found a way to include the connections between components in anintegrated circuit thus automating the entire process photo an integrated circuit seen from the inside photo by courtesy of nasa glenn research center  asa rc  integrated circuits as much as transistors helped to shrinkcomputers during the 1960s in 1943 ibm boss thomas watson hadreputedly quipped   think there is a world market for about fivecomputers  just two decades later the company and its competitors hadinstalled around 25 00 large computer systems across the unitedstates as the 1960s wore on integrated circuits became increasinglysophisticated and compact soon engineers were speaking of large caleintegration  si  in which hundreds of components could be crammedonto a single chip and then very large cale integrated  lsi  whenthe same chip could contain thousands of components the logical conclusion of all this miniaturization was that omeday someone would be able to squeeze an entire computer onto achip in 1968 robert noyce and gordon moore had left fairchild toestablish a new company of their own with integration very much intheir minds they called it integrated electronics or intel for short riginally they had planned to make memory chips but when the companylanded an order to make chips for a range of pocket calculators istory headed in a different direction a couple of their engineers federico faggin  941 dash  and marcian edward  ed hoff  937 dash  realized thatinstead of making a range of specialist chips for a range ofcalculators they could make a universal chip that could be programmed to work inthem all thus was born the general urpose single chip computer ormicroprocessor 8212 nd that brought about the next phase of the computerrevolution personal computers by 1974 intel had launched a popular microprocessor known as the8080 and computer hobbyists were soon building home computers around it he first was the mits altair 8800 built by edroberts  with its front panel covered in red led lights andtoggle switches it was a far cry from modern pcs and laptops even so t sold by the thousand and earned roberts a fortune the altairinspired a californian electronics wizard name stevewozniak  950 dash  to develop a computer of his own  oz is oftendescribed as the hacker   acker  212  technically brilliant and highlycreative engineer who pushed the boundaries of computing largely forhis own amusement in the mid 970s he was working at thehewlett ackard computer company in california and spending his freetime tinkering away as a member of the homebrew computer club in thebay area after seeing the altair woz used a 6502 microprocessor  ade by anintel rival mos technology to build a better home computer of hisown the apple i when he showed off his machine to his colleagues atthe club they all wanted one too one of his friends steve jobs  955 dash 011  persuaded woz that they shouldgo into business making the machine woz agreed so famously they setup apple computer corporation in a garage belonging to jobs parents fter selling 175 of the apple i for the devilish price of  66 6 wozbuilt a much better machine called the apple    ronounced  ppletwo  while the altair 8800 looked like something out of a

things turned the apple   into a really credible machinefor small firms a disk drive unit launched in 1978 which made iteasy to store data and a spreadsheet program called visicalc whichgave apple users the ability to analyze that data in just two and ahalf years apple sold around 50 00 of the machine quicklyaccelerating out of jobs garage to become one of the world  biggestcompanies dozens of

indifferent ways most were programmed using a simple english ikelanguage called basic but each one used its own flavor of basic whichwas tied closely to the machine  hardware design as a result rograms written for one machine would generally not run on another onewithout a great deal of conversion companies who wrote softwareprofessionally typically wrote it just for one machine and onsequently there was no software industry to speak of in 1976 gary kildall  942 dash 994  ateacher and computer scientist and one of the founders of the homebrewcomputer club had figured out a solution to this problem kildallwrote an operating system   computer  fundamental control software alled cp  that acted as an intermediary between the user  programsand the machine  hardware with a

ibm called somissed out on one of the world  greatest deals but the truth seems tohave been that ibm wanted to buy cp  outright for just  00 00 whilekildall recognized his product was worth millions more and refused tosell instead ibm turned to a young programmer named bill gates  955 dash  is then tiny company microsoft rapidly put together an operating system called dos ased on a product called qdos  uick and dirty operating system  which they acquiredfrom seattle computer products some believe microsoft and ibm cheated kildallout of his place in computer history kildall himself accused them of copying his ideas thers think gates was simply the shrewder businessman either way the ibm pc powered by microsoft  operating system as a runaway success yet ibm  victory was short ived cannily bill gates had sold ibm therights to one flavor of dos  c os and retained the rights to a verysimilar version  s os for his own use when other computermanufacturers notably compaq and dell starting
