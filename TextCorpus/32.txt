peripherals  and computer software  It was the first successful personal computer company and the popularizer of the graphical user interface Headquarters are located in Cupertino California  Garage start p Apple Inc had its genesis in the lifelong dream of Stephen G Wozniak to build his own computer—a dream that was made suddenly feasible with the arrival in 1975 of the first commercially successful microcomputer  the Altair 8800 which came as a kit and used the recently invented microprocessor chip Encouraged by his friends at the Homebrew Computer Club a San Francisco Bay area group centred around the Altair Wozniak quickly came up with a plan for his own microcomputer In 1976 when the Hewlett ackard Company  where Wozniak was an engineering intern expressed no interest in his design Wozniak then 26 years old together with a former high chool classmate 21 ear ld Steven P Jobs  moved production operations to the Jobs family garage—and the Silicon Valley garage start p company legend was born Jobs and Wozniak named their company Apple For working capital Jobs sold his Volkswagen minibus and Wozniak his programmable calculator Their first model was simply a working circuit board but at Jobs's insistence the 1977 version was a stand lone machine in a custom olded plastic case in contrast to the forbidding steel boxes of other early machines This Apple II also offered a colour display and other features that made Wozniak's creation the first microcomputer that appealed to the average person Wozniak Steve Jobs Steve Steve Wozniak  eft and Steve Jobs holding

brash business novice whose appearance still bore traces of his hippie past Jobs understood that in order for the company to grow it would require professional management and substantial funding He convinced Regis McKenna a well nown public relations specialist for the semiconductor industry to represent the company he also secured an investment from Michael Markkula a wealthy veteran of the Intel Corporation who became Apple's largest shareholder and an influential member of Apple's board of directors The company became an instant success particularly after Wozniak invented a disk controller that allowed the addition of a low ost floppy disk drive that made information storage and retrieval fast and reliable With room to store and manipulate data the Apple II became the computer of choice for legions of amateur programmers Most notably in 1979 two Bostonians—Dan Bricklin and Bob Frankston—introduced the first personal computer spreadsheet  VisiCalc  creating what would later be known as a"killer app"  pplication  a software program so useful that it propels hardware sales While VisiCalc opened up the small usiness and consumer market for the Apple II another important early market was primary educational institutions By a combination of aggressive discounts and donations  nd an absence of any early competition  Apple established a commanding presence among educational institutions contributing to its platform's dominance of primary chool software well into the 1990s Get exclusive access to content from our 1768 First Edition with your subscription

the biggest since 1956 when the Ford Motor Company had gone public  ndeed by the end of 1980 Apple's valuation of nearly   billion was greater than Ford's  However Apple would soon face competition from the computer industry's leading player International Business Machines Corporation  IBM had waited for the personal computer market to grow before introducing its own line of personal computers the IBM PC  in 1981 IBM broke with its tradition of using only proprietary hardware components and software and built a machine from readily available components including the Intel microprocessor  and used DOS  isk operating system from the Microsoft Corporation  Because other manufacturers could use the same hardware components that IBM used as well as license DOS from Microsoft new software developers could count on a wide IBM PC ompatible market for their software Soon the new system had its own killer app the Lotus 1   spreadsheet which won an instant constituency in the business community—a market that the Apple II had failed to penetrate Macintosh and the first affordable GUI Apple had its own plan to regain leadership a sophisticated new generation of computers that would be dramatically easier to use In 1979 Jobs had led a team of engineers to see the innovations created at the Xerox Corporation's Palo Alto  alifornia Research Center  PARC   There they were shown the first functional graphical user interface  UI  featuring on creen windows a pointing device known as a mouse  and the use of icons or pictures to replace the awkward protocols required by all other computers Apple immediately incorporated these ideas into two new computers Lisa released in 1983 and the lower ost Macintosh  released in 1984 Jobs himself took over the latter project insisting that the computer should be not merely great but"insanely great  The result was a revelation—perfectly in tune with the unconventional science iction sque television commercial that introduced the Macintosh during the broadcast of the 1984 Super Bowl—a   00 computer unlike any that preceded it Apple  Lisa computer Courtesy of Apple Computer Inc Apple Inc Quick Facts date 1976  present related
