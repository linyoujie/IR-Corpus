start p apple inc had its genesis in the lifelong dream of stephen g wozniak to build his own computer—a dream that was made suddenly feasible with the arrival in 1975 of the first commercially successful microcomputer  the altair 8800 which came as a kit and used the recently invented microprocessor chip encouraged by his friends at the homebrew computer club a san francisco bay area group centred around the altair wozniak quickly came up with a plan for his own microcomputer in 1976 when the hewlett ackard company  where wozniak was an engineering intern expressed no interest in his design wozniak then 26 years old together with a former high chool classmate 21 ear ld steven p jobs  moved production operations to the jobs family garage—and the silicon valley garage start p

convinced regis mckenna a well nown public relations specialist for the semiconductor industry to represent the company he also secured an investment from michael markkula a wealthy veteran of the

controller that allowed the addition of a low ost floppy disk drive that made information storage and retrieval fast and reliable with room to store and manipulate data the apple ii became the computer of choice for legions of amateur programmers most notably in 1979 two bostonians—dan bricklin and bob frankston—introduced the first personal computer spreadsheet  visicalc  creating what would later be known as a "killer app "  pplication  a software program so useful that it propels hardware sales while visicalc opened up the small usiness and consumer market for the apple ii another important early market was primary educational institutions by a combination of aggressive discounts and donations  nd an absence of any early competition  apple established a commanding presence

microprocessor  and used dos  isk operating system from the microsoft corporation  because other manufacturers could use the same hardware components that ibm used as well as license dos from microsoft new software developers could count on a wide ibm pc ompatible market for their software soon the new system had its own killer app the lotus 1   spreadsheet which won an instant
