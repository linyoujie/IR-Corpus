no more alan turing condemned code breaker and computer visionary his ideas led to early versions of modern computing and helped win world war ii yet he died as a criminal for his homosexuality alan turing in 1951 though he is regarded today as one the most innovative thinkers of the 20th century at his death many of his wartime accomplishments were classified credit  godrey argent studio via the royal society june 5 2019 overlooked is a series of obituaries about remarkable people whose deaths beginning in 1851 went unreported in the times this month we 're adding the stories of important l     figures by alan cowell london — his genius embraced the first visions of modern computing and produced seminal insights into what became known as "artificial intelligence  as one of the most influential code breakers of world war ii his cryptology yielded intelligence believed to have hastened the allied victory but at his death several years later much of his secretive wartime accomplishments remained classified far from public view in a nation seized by the security concerns of the cold war instead by the narrow standards of his day his reputation was sullied on june 7 1954 alan turing a british mathematician who has since been acknowledged as one the most innovative and powerful thinkers of the 20th century — sometimes called the progenitor of modern computing — died as a criminal having been convicted under victorian laws as a homosexual and forced to endure chemical castration britain didn 't take its first steps toward decriminalizing homosexuality until 1967 only in 2009 did the government apologize for his treatment "we 're sorry — you deserved so much better  said gordon brown then the prime minister "alan and the many thousands of other gay men who were convicted as he was under homophobic laws were treated terribly  and only in 2013 did queen elizabeth ii grant turing a royal pardon 59 years after a housekeeper found his body at his home at wilmslow near manchester in northwest england a coroner determined that he had died of cyanide poisoning and that he had taken his own life "while the balance of his mind was disturbed  at his side lay a half aten apple biographers speculated that he had ingested the poison by dousing the apple with cyanide and eating it to disguise the toxin 's taste some of those who studied his personality or knew him most notably his mother ethel turing challenged the official verdict of suicide arguing that he had poisoned himself accidentally to this day turing is recognized in his own country and among a broad society of scientists as a pillar of achievement who had fused brilliance and eccentricity had moved comfortably in the abstruse realms of mathematics and cryptography but awkwardly in social settings and had been brought low by the hostile society into which he was born "he was a national treasure and we hounded him to his death  said john graham umming a computer scientist who campaigned for turing to be pardoned  above all turing 's name is associated for many people with the top ecret wartime operations of britain 's code reakers at bletchley park a sprawling estate north of london where he oversaw and inspired the effort to decrypt ciphers generated by nazi germany 's enigma machine which had once seemed impenetrable the germans themselves regarded the codes as unbreakable at the time german submarines were prowling the atlantic hunting allied ships carrying vital cargo for the war effort the convoys were critical for building military strength in britain and eventually enabled the allies to undertake the d ay landings in normandy in 1944 heralding the collapse of nazi germany the next year only by charting the submarines ' movements could allied forces change the course of their convoys and for that they relied on the cryptologists of bletchley park to decode messages betraying the germans ' deployments the enduring fascination with turing 's story inspired the 2014 movie "the imitation game  starring benedict cumberbatch and keira knightley but his scientific range went far beyond the limits of cinematic drama he laid down principles that have molded the historical record of the relationship between humans and the machines they have created to solve their problems even before world war ii turing was making breakthroughs credit for the creation of the first functioning computer in 1946 went to the researchers john presper eckert and john w mauchly for their machine the electronic numerical integrator and computer or eniac which they had developed at the university of pennsylvania during world war ii but turing 's notions preceded the eniac he conceived what became known as the universal turing machine which envisioned "one machine for all possible tasks " — essentially computers as we know them today andrew hodges turing 's biographer wrote in a condensed version of his 1983 book "alan turing the enigma  turing 's vision hodges said was that one machine could "be turned to any well efined task by being supplied with the appropriate program  he added "the universal turing machine naturally exploits what was later seen as the 'stored program ' concept essential to the modern computer it embodies the crucial 20th century insight that symbols representing instructions are no different in kind from symbols representing numbers  later technology that emerged from the manhattan project the united states ed effort to develop the atom bomb also relied on turing 's ideas "what had begun as a british idea was scaled up to industrial size by the americans  david kaiser a professor at the massachusetts institute of technology wrote in 2012 in the london review of books turing 's postwar work at the university of manchester on the first functioning british computers was also significant it reflected the emerging power of electronic computing in the cold war race for nuclear supremacy and he remained fascinated by the interplay between human thought processes and their computerized inventions even in 1944 hodges wrote turing had spoken to a colleague about "building a brain  in an article published in 1950 in the academic journal mind turing developed a method that came to be known as the "turing test  a sort of thought experiment to determine whether a computer could pass as a human as part of his experiment a human interrogator would ask questions and try to figure out whether the answers had come from a computer or a human many years later on a visit to london president barack obama placed turing in a trans tlantic pantheon of innovation and discovery saying "from newton and darwin to edison and einstein from alan turing to steve jobs we have led the world in our commitment to science and cutting dge research  alan mathison turing was born in london on june 23 1912 the second of two sons of ethel sara stoney and julius mathison turing who had met in imperial india where his father was a senior colonial administrator after alan 's birth they left him and his brother john in the care of foster parents in england while they returned to india so that alan 's father could continue his work "alan turing 's story was not one of family or tradition but of an isolated and autonomous mind  hodges wrote in his early days turing 's education reflected the overwhelming social requisite of his class to secure a place at a reputable private boarding school alan at age 13 enrolled at sherborne school in southern england where his fascination with science raised alarms in an educational system based on the study of what were called the classics — works in latin and ancient greek "if he is to be solely a scientific specialist he is wasting his time at a public school  nowell smith sherborne 's headmaster wrote to his parents as recorded in hodges 's book nonetheless he secured a place at king 's college in cambridge to study mathematics graduating in 1934 with a first class honors degree with remarkable academic precocity he was made a fellow of the college in 1935 a year later he published the groundbreaking paper "on computable numbers with an application to the entscheidungsproblem "  r "decidability problem "  a reference in german to a celebrated riddle that the american logician alonzo church had also explained both turing and church reached the same conclusion — a basis for computer science — that there is no single algorithm that could determine the truth or falsity of any statement in formal logic  hough turing 's thinking was more direct  turing completed a doctoral thesis at princeton in 1938 before returning to cambridge with britain 's declaration of war on germany in september 1939 he joined the bletchley park code breakers at the government code and cypher school working in makeshift huts clustered around a mansion their greatest initial challenge was figuring out the method of encryption of the german enigma device which was invented 20 years earlier by arthur scherbius a german electrical engineer who had patented it as a civilian machine to encrypt commercial messages the machine worked by entering letters on a typewriter ike keyboard and then encoding them through a series of rotors to a light board which showed the coded equivalents the machine was said to be capable of generating almost 159 quintillion permutations the british were helped initially by a polish mathematician who had been studying the enigma machine and had provided vital details after hitler 's forces invaded poland in 1939 but under the direction of turing and another cambridge ducated mathematician w  welchman the bletchley park code breakers greatly expanded and accelerated those early efforts using a huge contraption called the bombe they mimicked the operations of the enigma machine to break its codes "the critical factor was turing 's brilliant mechanization of subtle logical deductions  the biographer hodges wrote in 1942 turing was assigned to visit the united states for several months of high evel consultations on the encryption of conversations between president franklin d roosevelt and winston s churchill his wartime work earned him a high civilian award and he was named an officer of the most excellent order of the british empire in the postwar years turing 's fascination with computers led him to design the automatic computing engine although it was never built turing believed that "the computer would offer unlimited scope for practical progress toward embodying intelligence in an artificial form  hodges wrote in october 1948 turing began working at manchester university 's computing laboratory he bought a house in nearby wilmslow in 1950 among his enthusiasms were his work on various scientific themes including morphogenesis the theory of growth and form in biology his continued secret ties to britain 's postwar code breakers and long istance running he was also hodges said beginning to explore the homosexual identity he had hidden when he proposed marriage in 1941 to joan clarke a bletchley park cryptanalyst he later withdrew the offer after explaining his sexuality to her and the two remained friends about 10 years later the police were investigating a burglary at his home when he admitted to having had a physical relationship with a man named arnold murray murray told turing that he knew the thief 's identity and detectives in their questioning asked turing about his relationship to murray in march 1952 turing and murray were charged with "gross indecency  and both pleaded guilty in court murray was given a conditional discharge but turing was ordered to undergo chemical castration by taking doses of the female hormone estrogen to reduce sex drive two years later the motive for his apparent suicide at age 41 remained unclear and left many questions at the time hodges wrote known homosexuals were denied security clearances which meant that turing could not be involved in secret work during the cold war leaving him excluded and embittered while a coroner deemed the death a suicide the telltale apple at turing 's side was never forensically examined "eccentric solitary gloomy vivacious resigned angry eager dissatisfied — these had always been his ever arying characteristics  hodges wrote "and despite the strength that he showed the world in coping with outrageous fortune no one could safely have predicted his future course  advertisement continue reading the main story site index go to home page » news home page world u  politics
