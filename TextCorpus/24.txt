 and what lies ahead jon skillings july 20 2019 11 9 am pdt leer en español buzz aldrin stands on the moon beside seismic measurement gear part of the early apollo scientific experiments package to the right is the lunar module eagle nasa this story is part of to the moon  a series exploring humanity  first journey to the lunar surface and our future living and working on the moon even neil armstrong couldn  remember exactly what he said at that key moment in the first ver moon landing nasa   apollo 11 mission as he stepped onto the lunar surface you know the line  hat  one small step for man one giant leap for mankind   and you always wonder didn  he mean to say   for a man   in fairness he did have a lot on his mind even listening to the recording afterward armstrong still wasn  quite sure   would hope that history would grant me leeway for dropping the syllable and understand that it was certainly intended even if it wasn  said   although it actually might have been  he told biographer james r hansen enlarge image a footprint left on the moon by buzz aldrin nasa history has in fact remembered armstrong fondly and now we e celebrating the 50th anniversary of that moon landing  it was july 20 1969 when armstrong and fellow astronaut edwin  uzz aldrin made cosmic history as they became the first humans ever to stand and walk on a heavenly body not called earth it was a breathtaking engineering and logistical achievement humans had only started venturing into space less than a decade earlier   and even then just barely outside earth  atmosphere our experience of space which started with russian cosmonaut yuri gagarin in april 1961 was still quite limited when apollo 8 made a trip  ound the moon in december 1968 the first time humans had ever broken free of earth  orbit now playing watch this apollo 11 moon landing highlights from cbs news 3 1 but after a total of six moon landings for the apollo program in less than four years that was it since apollo 17 in december 1972 no one  been back to the moon nasa spent the next several decades focusing its manned spaceflight efforts on the space shuttle and on missions to the international space station now there are once again plans to put people on the moon nasa says it expects to make a new moon landing by 2024 through its artemis program  both for its own sake and as a stepping tone toward eventual missions to mars  meanwhile amazon founder jeff bezos and spacex founder elon musk also have their eyes on lunar adventures as nasa and others mark the 50th anniversary of the first moon landing here  a look back at that achievement   and at what lies ahead real quick how far away is the moon anyway the distance from the earth to the moon varies because of the moon  elliptical orbit from about 225 00 miles  63 00 kilometers to 252 00 miles by comparison the iss is only about 250 miles away   that is one one housandth as far as the moon the apollo missions needed roughly three days travel time each way   apollo 11 got from earth to lunar orbit at midday on day three of its mission  or apollo 15 it was about 4  days from earth liftoff to touchdown on the lunar surface  the apollo 11 crew  eft to right  neil armstrong michael collins and buzz aldrin nasa that  an awfully long way to go why even bother two words space race starting in the 1950s the us and the soviet union were going at it for bragging rights and military advantage sending rockets satellites dogs and monkeys and eventually people into the ether then on may 25 1961 president john f kennedy made a brash declaration   believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal before this decade is out of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to earth no single space project in this period will be more exciting or more impressive or more important for the long ange exploration of space and none will be so difficult or expensive to accomplish  how did the astronauts get there the lunar missions lifted off atop a saturn v  rocket to date the most powerful ever after separation from the saturn rocket the astronauts continued to the moon in the command service module the csm had three parts the command module  m  with the classic  pace capsule shape and containing the crew  quarters and flight controls the expendable service module  m  which provided propulsion and support systems and the lunar module  m  which looked like a geometry project with spindly legs and which took two astronauts to the lunar surface while a third remained in the cm   how did the apollo 11 mission unfold what exactly did armstrong and aldrin do first of all they simply proved it could be done the overview apollo 11 lifted off from launch pad 39a at kennedy space center in florida on july 16 and returned to earth on july 24 splashing down in the pacific ocean after traveling a total of 953 54 miles in eight days three hours and 18 minutes on july 20 the lm  ickname eagle touched down in the moon  sea of tranquility after a stressful final few minutes  here were some pretty hairy moments  james hansen armstrong  biographer said in an interview  he onboard computer was taking them down into a site that was not quite what they wanted and neil had to take over manually they maybe had 20 or 30 seconds of fuel left when he actually got it down  apollo 11 moon landing neil armstrong  defining moment 35 photos about four hours later armstrong 38 years old stepped out just before 11 p  et on the 20th a sunday he was outside for about 2  hours with aldrin 39 joining him for about 1  hours they were on the moon for 21 hours 36 minutes  ncluding seven hours of sleep total before returning to orbit to rejoin the third member of the crew michael collins 38 who  been waiting watching and worrying venturing no more than 300 feet from the lm and working under a 200 egree sun armstrong and aldrin   like tourists everywhere   took lots of photos and video and gathered souvenirs in the form of moon rocks and soil samples they also set up a couple of rudimentary experiments one to measure seismic activity and another as a target for earth ased lasers to measure the earth oon distance precisely which returned data for 71 days they left behind an american flag some of the most famous footprints in history a coin ize silicon disc etched in microscopic detail with messages from world leaders and a small plaque saying  e came in peace for all mankind  armstrong may have the most famous lines from the mission and collins the best book  arrying the fire  but aldrin nailed the description of the moonscape  magnificent desolation   those moon rocks were a pretty big deal right that  right the apollo 11 crew brought back 22 kilograms  lmost 50 pounds of lunar material including rocks modest core samples and that dusty lunar soil that  so great for making footprints the sample included basalt  rom molten lava  breccia  ragments of older rocks and anorthosite  urface rock that may have been part of an ancient crust  those moon rocks and other samples from all the apollo missions helped scientists get a better understanding of the moon  origins  flight controllers at nasa  mission control celebrate on july 24 1969 as the apollo 11 astronauts return to earth nasa tell me they brought some tunes with them they did indeed nasa sent along a sony tc 0 cassette player with a mixtape of songs for the ride up  pparently the astronauts really were supposed to use it for recording notes about what they were up to  aldrin  selections included glen campbell  galveston blood sweat  mp tears spinning wheel and a song called mother country by folk singer john stewart armstrong went in a different direction with dvorak  new world symphony and the theremin eavy music out of the moon by samuel hoffman what did they eat definitely not haute cuisine sandwiches with spreads out of a tube like ham salad tuna salad chicken salad cheddar cheese snacks including peanut cubes caramel candy bacon bites and dried apricots peaches and pears turkey dinner of a sort with gravy and dressing   eaten with a spoon drinks included water grapefruit range juice grape punch and coffee reconstituted of course in addition not long after landing on the moon aldrin took holy communion  with a wafer and a small vial of wine what else was going on in 1969 it was a crazy time airline hijacking was a big thing especially to cuba the vietnam war was raging as were protests against it honduras and el salvador fought a  occer war  the stonewall riots in new york took place in late june richard nixon had only just begun his first term as us president apollo software engineer margaret hamilton and the source code for the apollo guidance computer nasa on the technology front the us would get its first atm in september and the first message sent on the arpanet  a precursor to the internet would happen in late october for about a week as may turned into june john lennon and yoko ono staged their  ed n in amsterdam at which lennon recorded give peace a chance the beatles get back was no 1 for five weeks from may into june and the fifth dimension  aquarius et the sunshine in was no 2 david bowie released space oddity on july 11 the middle of august would bring the woodstock festival debuts on tv that september and october would include scooby oo the brady bunch and monty python  flying circus and turnabout intruder  the final episode of the original star trek series aired june 3 how many people have been on the moon the apollo missions put a total of 12 men on the lunar surface over the course of six visits that  it then there were the others who e flown that astonishing distance but never touched down   six cm pilots on the lunar landing missions plus the crews of apollo 8 10 and 13 three of those people made the trip twice so the grand total of humans who e been as far as the moon is 24 here  who  been on the moon apollo 11

may 1972 and apollo 17   which spent three full days on the moon   wrapped things up in december of 1972 apollo 13 in april 1970 had to forgo its moon landing because of a life hreatening technical problem what else has landed on the moon we e put all kinds of unmanned spacecraft on the moon starting with the hard landing of the soviet union  luna 2 in 1959 the us first spacecraft on the moon ranger 4 arrived in april 1962 both countries landed a number of other machines there during the 1960s including five surveyor spacecraft from the us only some of them were soft  r powered landings

countries have been getting into the game china put the chang  3 onto the moon in 2013 making the first soft landing since luna 24 in 1976 in january of this year china  chang  4 became the first

chandrayaan  mission  which will make the first soft landing at the lunar south pole it  carrying a lander a rover and an orbiter the launch has been delayed several times most recently on july 14 where does president trump stand on missions to the moon nasa has been fired up for a return to the moon at least since december 2017 when president donald trump signed white house space policy directive 1  which urged a renewed focus on lunar missions  eginning with missions beyond low arth orbit  the directive states  he united states will lead the return of humans to the moon for long erm exploration and utilization followed by human missions to mars and other destinations  curiously trump tweeted in may that  asa should not be talking about going to the moon  we did that 50 years ago  the tweet did go on to suggest that he still sees the moon as part of nasa  eventual missions to mars for all of the money we are spending nasa should not be talking about going to the moon  we did that 50 years ago they should be focused on the much bigger things we are doing including mars  f which the moon is a part  defense and science — donald j trump  realdonaldtrump june 7 2019 that came less than a month after the trump administration said it wanted an extra    billion added to nasa  budget for next year to help pave the way for humans to return to the moon in the coming decade money seems like it could be an issue especially as congress grapples with the federal budget for fiscal 2020 on july 17 nasa administrator jim bridenstine testified before a senate panel about the chilling effect that a budget freeze   a continuing resolution to keep spending at 2019  level   could have on plans for a return to the moon in the middle of the next decade  t would be devastating what we lack right now is a lander  bridenstine said  e don  have money in the budget right now to develop a lander  so what comes next as things stand the space agency plans to send astronauts back to the surface of the moon by 2024 in what  now known as the artemis program with a whole new rocket  he space launch system and crew capsule  orion   the program will eventually integrate a   ateway
