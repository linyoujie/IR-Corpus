along that humanity was able to start computing difficult equations and running complex programs with ease The invention of the computer has allowed us to now share all of our knowledge with each other on the internet However if we look back at the history of the oldest computer we see that computers are really not that new of an idea after all Although the vast majority of the computers that we know about today were created within the past 100 years human ingenuity dates back further than many of us can likely imagine To help put this in perspective here are the 10 oldest known computers In the event of later models which were introduced by the same manufacturer some models were taken off of this list to allow for a more diverse group of machines If you are new to the history of computers some of the below systems will blow your mind The oldest computer in known history is actually a lot more ancient than most of us would have previously imagined Just keep in mind that many different exact dates and models along with their inventors may have also been lost in history 10 Universal Automatic Computer 1  NIVAC 1 Year Invented 1951 Country  USA Main Feature  Commercial Size

developers a hint at what computer technology was capable of doing Interesting Facts Designed by Alan Turing who recently inspired cryptocurrency developers to create a"Turing omplete" currency Had a processing speed of 1 MHz which was the fastest in the world at the time Assisted British air defense in the Cold War The third stored rogram computer to be invented in England 7 Manchester Mark 1 Year Invented 1948 Country  England Main Feature  Stored Program Computer Size  17"   x 4' x   x 7 5'   Being built by the Small Scale Experimental Machine  SEM or"Baby"  the Manchester Mark 1 was the first computer to show the potential of where this sophisticated technology was going to end up Being able to use RAM run user reated programs and having all the components of the basic computer this machine was invented decades before any Apple or Windows computer  orry Steve Jobs and Bill Gates  Interesting Facts Likely the first computer to use index registers One of the first computers that could store data and any user program One of the first computers that had all the basic components considered to be part of a basic computer Ran with Random Access Memory  AM  which is still widely used today 6 ENIAC 1 Year Invented 1946 Country  USA Main Feature  Weapon eployment calculations Size  100'   x 3'   x 8'   photo source WikiMedia Being one of the oldest computers this is also one of the first computers used for the purpose of war Although it was completed in 1946 at the end of WWII it was crucial in helping assist during later conflicts such as the Cold War and Korean War It was also used to calculate the likelihood of developing the H omb one of the most powerful weapons ever tested Interesting Facts Could add or subtract two ten igit number at a speed of 5000 per second Was also capable of advanced division multiplication and square oots Was capable of storing results of calculations Was also used to calculate the possibility of producing the H omb https  ww outube om

widely used to develop weapons of war near the end of WWII Having assisted with the development of radar surveillance lenses underwater detection torpedoes and even assisting with the atomic bomb this computer can actually be attributed with helping the Allies win the war Although this computer wasn't used commercially it is regardless one of the oldest computers to date It was quickly followed up by the Mark II and various other later models Interesting Facts Used During World War II Developed by one of the people who worked on the Manhattan Project Used to help the Navy design equipment such as torpedoes and underwater detection Also assisted in the design of implosion devices for the atomic bomb 4 Colossus Mark 1 Year Invented 1943 Country  England Main Feature  Wireless Message Interception Size  17'   x 11'   x 7'   This computer is one of the first major advancements for British intelligence services Being used to read high evel messages from the Germans in WWII this device was used to intercept messages that helped guarantee an Allied victory in WWII Since this device was primarily used for intelligence purposes to intercept wireless messages it is considered very advanced for its time There were around 10 of these devices being used by the end of the war Interesting Facts Was invented right before the Normandy"D ay" invasion Used to intercept and decode high evel German messages during WWII The Colossus Mark two quintupled the processing speed Around 10 of these devices were used by British intelligence by the end of WWII 3 Atanasoff erry Computer  BC Year Invented 1942 Country  USA Main Feature  Digital Computing Size  1797  square feet This computer was invented by Iowa State professor John Vincent Atanasoff while being assisted by student Clifford Berry When the two combined their names the acronym ABC was created to mark the creation of this computer Since Interesting Facts Known to be the first automatic electronic digital computing computer Was designed to solve up to 29 systems of simultaneous linear equations Was likely the first electronic digital computer for solving math problems Wasn't widely known as the first automatic electronic computer until a lawsuit concluded so in 1973 against the ENIAC 2 Z1 Year Invented 1936 Country  Germany Main Feature  Freely Programmable Size  Built in a living room although unknown since it was destroyed WWII was a period of massive technological development despite the massive destruction of land and lives that it caused Although Nazi Germany is notorious for murdering over 12 million people in their concentration camps they also were behind some of modern man's most important inventions The computer is one of those things Since the development of ZI was privately unded we have Konrad Zuse to thank for this and not Adolf Hitler Additionally there were two later models the Z2 and Z3 invented before the Atanasoff erry Computer was finished Interesting Facts The original Z1 was destroyed when Allied forces bombed Berlin in 1943 The daughter of this computer the Z2 was invented in 1939 This machine's granddaughter was built in 1941 before the Atanasoff erry Computer 1
