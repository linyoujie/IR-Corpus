apple  origins an oral history from inside the loop alums share memories as apple marks another anniversary spoiler bill gates had a bigger role in apple  success than he may know shara tibken april 1 2019 5 0 am pdt clement mok editors note this article originally ran april 1 2016 for apple  40th anniversary  whether apple was actually started by two guys in a california garage may be debatable  but what  certain is that the pioneering computer maker turned consumer electronics juggernaut has come a long way forty hree years after steve jobs and steve wozniak set out to turn computers into a tool that anyone could use apple has become one of the most valuable brands in the world with some of the most successful products ever made apple has shaped countless industries from computing to music and its former employees have gone on to innovate and create new tech industries around everything from enterprise software to smart thermostats it has reinvented itself numerous times changing from apple computer to the iphone maker apple now is going through another transition as smartphone sales slow the company is making a bigger push in services with its first tv streaming  game streaming  news subscription and credit card offerings unveiled during an event in march   at its heart apple has always been about creating elegant easy o se products we never even knew we wanted   t was love at first sight when i first encountered the apple ii at the inaugural west coast computer faire in april 1977  said andy hertzfeld one of the original members of the macintosh team who designed the system  software   continue to be thrilled by new apple products to this day  other former apple executives and partners shared their favorite memories of the company and jobs who was to many people the driving force behind its success they include former finance execs debi coleman and susan barnes ex pple designer clement mok technical visionary alan kay chief evangelist guy kawasaki and jobs marketing mentor regis mckenna here  what they had to say 90 hours a week and loving it apple  first success came from the apple ii computer and it tried to follow that up with the lisa but early apple became better known for another computer the macintosh the mac started as a research project in the late  0s with only four employees before becoming jobs pet project by january 1981 there was a lot of competition between the apple ii lisa and mac teams for one off ite retreat the mac group which flew the pirate flag over its offices had gray hoodies printed up they read  0 hours a week and loving it  in a red and black font recalled coleman who joined apple in 1981 as finance controller for the mac enlarge image mark hobbs net every member of the mac team about 100 people at that time got the hoodie it was a hit  ee the photo courtesy of mok at the top of this story   ithin a week of coming back  rom the retreat  the lisa group had a shirt that said  orking 70 hours a week and shipping product,  coleman said   week later the apple ii group which was making all the money hand over fist had a shirt that said  orking 50 hours a week and making profits   ho knew it was going to cause a reaction across the entire campus  coleman added she became head of mac manufacturing in 1984 and was one of the highest anking women in the tech industry she took over the role of apple chief financial officer in 1986 at a november reunion of some women on the mac team  coleman attributed a big part of apple  success to jobs saying he made people at apple believe they could change the world look and feel like the beatles as he was getting ready to launch the mac jobs wanted the computer  o look and feel like the beatles not the late beatles but the early beatles  remembered mok a designer hired by apple to work on branding for the mac launch  om hughes  he creative director on the mac team and myself scratched our heads what the hell is that  they decided it meant there was a certain rawness to the mac but with a sense of passion and artistry  t  an artistic expression of technology  said mok who joined apple in 1982  his product has been crafted  enlarge image the branding for the first mac featured a squiggly line drawing of the computer later dubbed the  icasso logo  image courtesy of clement mok  hey were so successful in giving apple a beatles feel that apple corps the company that owned the rights to the beatles music sued the cupertino california company for trademark infringement the two sides had a long unning legal tussle but ultimately reached a settlement in 2007 and in 2012 sorted out ownership of the logo   mok became co anager of apple creative services in 1985 and served as creative director for corporate and the education market he  one of the people responsible for the iconic imagery of apple in its marketing and packaging including the squiggly line drawings gracing early mac promotional materials but one aspect of the mac that squiggly line design didn  feel as much like the beatles to mok as it felt like joni mitchell jobs wanted to mimic the logo for the now efunct ciao restaurant in san francisco  financial district   tried but couldn  for the life of me put it together  mok recalled apple ended up hiring the man who created the ciao logo in the first place john casado what came from the team is what  known as the macintosh picasso logo some branding elements from the first mac live on today including the minimalist white packaging used for apple  devices find a way early apple employees most in their 20s and 30s were given big responsibilities  et  just do it find a way and don  be afraid of the consequences  susan barnes  teve used to have a saying  e hire smart people to tell us what to do not hire them to tell them what to do,  said susan barnes who joined apple in 1981 as financial controller of the mac division she worked closely with coleman in her early days at apple and ended up reporting directly to jobs for a decade barnes co ounded next computer with jobs in 1985 and became its cfo at one point in early 1985 while still at apple jobs called coleman and barnes on a friday night and said he wanted to buy a chunk of adobe systems apple and adobe were closely linked in their early history with the two working together to develop desktop publishing technology  t  something we really needed in the mac days  barnes said of adobe  software and fonts  aser printing is something that really made the mac take off  barnes and coleman went to the law library late at night trying to figure out how to buy a stake of another company  ow do we do this  barnes said  his is usually what you ask senior management and we were like  h we are senior management. it sort of hit you  apple  biggest milestones 17 photos apple ended up investing    million for a 19 9 percent stake in adobe in early 1985 in 1989 it sold the stake which had been diluted to about 16 percent for  4 million  hen you e in corporations later it  so easy to hide behind  et me check with that person,  barnes said at apple it was  o it  you let  just do it find a way and don  be afraid of the consequences  orwellian 1984 jobs recruited john sculley in the early 1980s to help him grow apple as a company sculley was ceo of pepsi and helped it overtake coca ola as the top beverage maker jobs famously convinced sculley to take the ceo role at apple in 1983 by asking if he wanted to  ell sugar water for the rest of his life or if he wanted to  ome with me and change the world  sculley who was close with jobs before ousting him in 1985 served as apple  ceo for a decade until being forced out himself more on the creation of the mac steve jobs legacy includes the women he inspired the macintosh turns 30 going the distance apple execs reflect on the macintosh at 30 in the fall of 1983 sculley jobs other apple executives and two members of the chiat ay advertising firm   lee clow and steve hayden   were brainstorming about the mac launch campaign business week had run a cover story that week saying  he winner is ibm   e hadn  even come out with the mac so we were all a little bit down in the dumps  sculley said  hat can we do that will stop the world and get people to pay attention to the fact the game wasn  over it hadn  even started yet  the group started talking about the big things that would happen in 1984 and the obvious reference to george orwell  dystopian novel  984  came up they debated thinking that many marketers might play off the  984 reference but they hoped to get the leap by coming out with something in january   perfect timing with the super bowl enlarge image steve jobs and john sculley worked together closely in the early years of apple but only spoke one other time after jobs was ousted from the company in 1985  f we do something absolutely heart topping on the launch in january then we l preempt it and nobody else will want to use it because it will look like they e stolen the idea  sculley said the chiat ay executives had a week to come up with a campaign like  o one had ever seen before  the 60 econd  984 commercial they created turned out to be one of the most celebrated ads of all time  but apple  board hated it  t the end of the 60 econd commercial there was dead silence in the room  sculley said  wo directors put their heads on the table then they turned to me and said  ou e not going to run that are you? i said  bsolutely it  the best commercial i e ever seen.  the commercial cost  00 00 to produce which was about five to 10 times the normal expense sculley said and apple paid   million for 2 minutes of airtime during the super bowl the board told chiat ay to sell the time but they could only offload 1 inute so the commercial ran  e ended up getting  5 million of estimated free advertising because the networks kept running it over and over in its full length  sculley said  t turned out to be an amazing start for the macintosh  apple is a religion apple knew the first mac wouldn  succeed unless there was software for it getting developers to write software for the computer fell to guy kawasaki who joined apple in 1983 as the mac  first chief evangelist  t was easy to get people to begin writing software because we were breaking new ground for the marketing of computers and opening a new market for computers  he said  e provided a good alternative to the ibm pc and   developers could write software they always dreamed about writing  but it wasn  easy to get developers to actually finish writing their software they were working with an immature platform and dealing with the mac  new graphical user interface enlarge image steve jobs was ousted from apple in 1985 but returned in 1997 james martin net kawasaki avoided jobs as much as he could because jobs  cared the shit out of him one day jobs came to kawasaki  cubicle to introduce him to someone and to ask kawasaki what he thought of a company   say  t  mediocre and the product is crap,  kawasaki said  t the end of my diatribe he says  his is the ceo of the company.    passed the steve jobs test  kawasaki added  robably he knew the company was crap if i had said it was great it could have been my last day at apple  kawasaki ended up leaving apple in 1987 to start his own company he returned as an apple fellow in 1995  hen apple was supposed to die   he very fact they brought me back was because the cult was dying  kawasaki said getting people excited about apple again  asn  easy but it also wasn  impossible   here  a core of people who never lost faith in apple  kawasaki said  pple is a religion  bill gates to the rescue when jobs left apple in 1985 he started next a new computer company focused on workstations for universities financial institutions and other businesses while the computer didn  sell well  cs running microsoft windows were the most popular at the time  next had very interesting software  teve called me and he said  ey i  starting this new company it  an amazing computer for education,  said tom suiter who served as apple  first director of creative services and helped launch the mac in 1984 he left apple after jobs departure in 1985 but kept in touch with apple  co ounder over the years that included the time jobs was setting up next   could not believe how many times  ill gates was using  ext in such a positive way i counted them up and said  ext would be a cool name for a company  tom suiter suiter remembers his conversation with jobs about naming the new company   said  ongrats it  great what are you going to call it? jobs said  wo. i said  hat do you mean? jobs said  t  my second company. i said  verybody  going to go what happened to one? jobs said  hat  exactly why i  talking to you i need some help. i said  et me think about it.  that weekend suiter flew to seattle to attend a cd om conference hosted by microsoft and keynoted by co ounder bill gates   could not believe how many times he was using  ext in such a positive way i counted them up and said  ext would be a cool name for a company  when suiter got home on sunday he called jobs and said he had the perfect name for his new company  e goes  ey what is it? more on apple  40th cnet  full coverage of apple at 40 happy birthday apple welcome to middle age apple  marketing at 40 from reality distortion to the real thing my apple gig helping  people untangle the world wide web i said  t  next. there was like this silence then he said, i love it! the rest is history   the irony is it actually came from the mouth of bill gates to help steve  suiter never told jobs his inspiration for the next name  t probably would have diluted the brilliance of what the name was  he said laughing microsoft didn  just unwittingly help out apple it also invested  50 million in the company in the summer of 1997 to keep apple afloat as it was close to going out of business as part of the deal apple made microsoft  then nderdog internet explorer the default browser for the mac and gates agreed to develop future versions of microsoft office and development tools for the mac   an arrangement that helped apple win over customers tied to microsoft  software jobs hired suiter again in 1998 while suiter was at silicon valley advertising agency cks group to lead marketing communications for all apple products including the launch of the imac inventing the future in the 1970s alan kay one of the fathers of computing worked at xerox parc the palo alto california ased research group that inspired the mac user interface and other early apple products kay joined apple in 1984 a few months after the mac was unveiled kay famously said  he best way to predict the future is to invent it  he remembers jobs ouster by apple  board of directors and the company  struggle to recover  t is not easy to summarize  hat could have beens and  hat should have beens because steve both had some vision and was also seriously nutty along a number of lines he and i were friends despite this   as much as he could have a friend now playing watch this watch users sound off on mac v pc debate in 1995 1 6   few years later i was contacted by some long tanding colleagues in computer graphics   who were then at lucasfilm and wanted to get out i drove up to next and briefed steve on these folks and then i took steve up to marin county to meet the people who became pixar the funding of pixar and hanging in with the serious talent they had was almost certainly steve  finest period  kay however has been critical of apple  reinvention after jobs returned to apple in 1997  he return of steve to apple and his transformation of the company into one mainly aimed at consumer marketing was only successful from a business standpoint the ideals that apple had in the early  0s about  heels for the mind were now long gone     talked with steve off and on since then until his death and he would periodically send me stuff for my opinion invite me to product openings etc   would periodically try to get him back to being  entrally serious about education etc i once tried to get him to remember what he had said to john sculley to get him away from pepsi ( o you want to sell sugar water all your life or do you want to change the world?    the point being that steve  largest preoccupation after coming back was to get apple to be a success primarily by selling  ugar water to consumers  funny how things turn out when jobs and wozniak were starting apple they knew they needed savvy marketing and public relations help to launch the world  first personal computer they liked intel  campaigns so asked the chipmaker who was doing work for it intel told them it was regis mckenna that began a relationship between jobs and mckenna that lasted from 1976 until jobs death in 2011 mckenna  firm regis mckenna inc  helped launch the mac in 1984 though the formal relationship between the firm and apple ended in the early 1990s mckenna stayed close with jobs and spoke with him about once a month for the duration of the apple co ounder  life  e said   think these products we have coming are pretty good. he didn  say great he was a little bit skeptical until the first imacs the colorful ones took off like crazy  regis mckenna that included the period after jobs return to apple jobs rejoined apple in february 1997 after the company bought next for  29 million and he was asked to serve as a consultant to then eo gil amelio less than five months later jobs convinced the board to fire amelio and name him interim ceo  e went from when he had no position on the board and was not an adviser and ended up taking over the company  said mckenna  hose people amelio and others quite frankly didn  know what hit them  jobs didn  stay interim ceo for long but he faced a daunting task  pple was in horrible shape  mckenna said jobs  asn  sure he could fix it people don  realize it took several years for him to get it off the ground it didn  just happen  jobs ultimately turned apple around by dramatically cutting the company  product line and introducing one hit product after another   the colorful imac computers then the ipod music player itunes store iphone and ipad  hey cut out 50 percent or 60 percent of the products being developed  mckenna said enlarge image apple launched the ipod in october 2001 which offered   00 songs in your pocket  it wasn  until two years later in october 2003 that the itunes music store started working on windows pcs kim kulish orbis saba  teve calls me up   they were just about to launch their online store just about to launch itunes   he was all excited he said   think these products we have coming are pretty good. he didn  say great he was a little bit skeptical until the first imacs the colorful ones took off like crazy  most people involved with apple  early years never expected it to grow as big as it is today jobs among them after he returned to apple and it was successful and growing  ne of the things he said was  unny how things turn out.  mckenna said  e was just reminiscent it surprised him he didn  expect these things  p until a product was successful he always questioned if it was good enough he never felt when he launched a product  hat it was good enough but he would sell it as if it were in fact he always felt there could be more or better  eatures  his comment of  unny how things turn out was a sort of comment by him that it all surprised him  concentrate on industrial design apple  colorful imac line and jobs close relationship with designer jony ive helped the company recover from near eath tim bajarin a longtime industry analyst focused on apple remembers what jobs vowed to do to save his company when he first returned to apple  hen steve came back to apple i met with him the second day he came back  said bajarin who began following apple in 1981 for the firm creative strategies   asked  ow are you going to save apple? the first thing he said was    going to go back and take care of the core needs of our customers   engineering and graphics designers i  going to go back and make sure we take care of those customers. the next generation of the mac was more powerful and had more support for that particular group  hen he told me   at the time what i thought was one of the craziest things i  heard   that    going to concentrate on industrial design. i remember walking away and saying  ow in the world is industrial design going to save apple? as you know it ended up being a core tenet of apple  success a year later apple introduced the candy colored all n ne apple imacs  ive became the lead designer behind apple  most important products including the iphone cook named him chief design officer a year ago bajarin meanwhile continues to follow apple for creative strategies will anyone show up ron johnson the company  onetime retail chief said one of his most notable memories at apple was the opening of the first apple store in mclean virginia he remembered the moment exactly may 19 2001 at 10 a  johnson helped dream up the concept of the stores bright simple look with long wooden tables holding a handful of apple devices that people could test the design was a departure from the typical stores with aisles and aisles of shelves filled with products apple  retail approach has since been copied by others including microsoft thirty minutes before the first store opened johnson got a call from jobs who asked how many people were in line outside johnson told him there were about 50 customers unhappy with the low turnout jobs said they should e marketed the opening   the company sent out an email and press release but hadn  done any advertising johnson assured jobs folks would show up now playing watch this most iconic apple products ever made 2 5 by the time the store opened there were 1 00 people in line  t went from 50 people to 1 00 in a 30 inute period of time  johnson said  t was really fun  now with over 500 apple stores worldwide apple  stores have become hubs for fans to camp out often waiting in long lines for the newest gadgets to go on sale while many other retailers are closing locations amid weak store traffic apple stores bring in the highest sales per square foot of any retail locations in the us according to emarketer  johnson said jobs sought to create retail stores  o we can market innovation face o ace with customers johnson saw that mission in full effect when he witnessed the iphone launch in 2007 he was among a huge crowd at the company  iconic fifth avenue store in manhattan  t really showed steve  genius at its peak  johnson said  t was the marriage of an incredible product strategy with the ability to communicate with an unparalleled customer experience  that  ha moment what impact has apple had on society you can see it when an 8 ear ld boy swipes at a microwave screen puzzled that nothing happens you can  really fault him after all we all instinctively use our fingers and gestures to control our phones and computers so why not other gadgets with big screens that child  uncle at mp  vice chairman ralph de la vega can trace our reliance on our fingers back to the first time jobs showed him the iphone which he calls his  ha moment  he was one of the first people to see the device and had to sign a nondisclosure agreement vowing not to tell anyone about the phone including the ceo and board of at mp    or his wife 18 apple products that changed the world 19 photos de la vega  first question when seeing the iphone was  here  the stylus   the iphone dramatically changed how users interfaced with the device  de la vega said  t really highlights how it changes the expectations of people  while there had been touchscreens before the iphone apple was the first to show the benefits of ditching a stylus a move that had a massive impact on the tech industry without apple we might all still be mashing physical buttons  pple accelerated the pace so dramatically it changed everything  de la vega said at mp  became the first wireless carrier to sell the iphone something that helped the carrier attract millions of customers and the iphone has helped apple become the biggest company on the planet on to the next 40 cnet  roger cheng and ben fox
