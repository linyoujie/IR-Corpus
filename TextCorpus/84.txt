long is a day on Saturn Scientists Post your preprints on Twitter  A science writer might notice it and write about it That  how it happens that I  writing today about a new measurement of the rotation period of Saturn that is different from past measurements One of the Cassini mission  goals was to figure out how long a day on Saturn is We still don  know I actually think that  kind of wonderful I often argue that a reason that space science is so accessible is that the questions that space scientists ask are very easy questions for the general public to understand Is there life elsewhere nbsp Why is Venus different from Earth If I lived on Saturn how long would a day be there  ow long is one day on Saturn  is such a seemingly simple question The Voyager missions gave us one answer 10 hours 39 minutes 24 seconds  hat is 10  hours  This by the way is really fast It  so fast that Saturn is very clearly oblate   it  dramatically fatter at the equator than the poles 10 percent wider than it is high  upiter rotates fast too and is also oblate but less so  NASA  JPL altech  SSI  Kevin M Gill Natural color global view of Saturn and its rings Saturn visible with Titan

in magnetic fields generate radio emissions All the giant planets have magnetic fields If the magnetic field has any angle to the rotation pole then the magnetic field sweeps around the planet like the beam of a lighthouse and there  a pulsing to the radio emissions in time with the planet  rotation rate Voyager precisely measured the day lengths of Jupiter  9h 55m 29 1s   Uranus  17h 14 m  lusmn 0 m   and Neptune  16h 6 m  lusmn 0 m  as well as Saturn When Cassini got to Saturn it also measured Saturn  rotation rate from its radio emissions The answer   10 hours 45 minutes 45  lusmn 36 seconds   was more than 6 minutes longer than the Voyager measurement  hat  10  hours  Saturn didn  slow down between Voyager in 1981 and Cassini in 2004 there is no force in the solar system that could have made such a massive planet slow its rotation so much so rapidly One   or both   of the measurements was wrong Later on in the Cassini mission the team realized that their data showed different rotation rates in the northern and southern hemispheres  Clearly the method of using radio emissions to measure Saturn  rotation rate did not work the way it did at other giant planets They are measuring something rotating but it  not the bulk rotation of the planet The Cassini magnetometer and radio and plasma wave science teams spent the rest of the mission trying to find a signal in their data that accurately represented the rotation rate of Saturn They were working on lots of other science too and were very successful but they failed to solve the problem of its rotation rate Not for lack of trying  nd they e still trying  but just because the universe just doesn  work the way we thought it did and the apparently simple question about the length of Saturn  day remains to be answered with other methods NASA  JPL altech  Space Science Institute  Don Davis The last look at Saturn from the Cassini spacecraft The last color mosaic of Saturn obtained by the Cassini spacecraft as it approached its end on 15 September 2017 All that preamble leads up to a paper now available at ArXiv  Cassini Ring Seismology as a Probe of Saturn squo  Interior I Rigid Rotation   by Christopher Mankovich Mark Marley Jonathan Fortney and Naor Movshovitz It approaches Saturn  rotation rate in a very different way using ring seismology Some wave structures in Saturn  rings are sensitive to the gravity field of Saturn Gravity is a powerful way to investigate the deep interior of a planet By understating how waves in the rings are influenced by Saturn  gravity Mankovich and coworkers were able to describe the interior layering of Saturn and also derive its rotation rate in a way that  completely independent of the radio agnetometer measurements Their number 10 hours 35     1  minutes  r 10  hours  is considerably faster than the weirdly varying radio rotation rates NASA  JPL altech  SSI Unexpected C ring corrugations The lighting geometry in this image is extreme It was taken just hours before equinox mostly of the C ring one of the dimmest of Saturn  main rings The B ring  inner boundary is on the right the C ring  Maxwell gap  emarcated by two bright arcs which are bright because they rise above the ring plane is on the left There is a periodic brightness variation in the image The side lighting geometry means that brightness variations mostly result from changing slopes of the surface of the ring plane due to out f lane disturbances in the rings   in layman  terms the rings here are corrugated like a washboard Previous images had revealed these corrugations in the D ring  ocated off the view to the left  This image reveals that the corrugation extends beyond their origin in the D ring  hich begins not far above Saturn  cloud tops  right through the C ring to the inner part of the B ring the densest of Saturn  rings covering a distance of 17 00 kilometers This was a wholly unexpected observation I will try to explain ring seismology but it  not easy There is a good explanation in this paper  ection 3   Feel free to skip this paragraph   you don  need it to get the rest of the article Saturn  ike other planets has internal vibrations   it rings like a bell on many different frequencies   very deep oned bell to be sure  These internal vibrations cause little perturbations in its gravity field in the space close in to the planet Saturn unusually among planets has a lot of particles orbiting in the space close to the planet that form a structure that we can see and measure   the C ring Certain frequencies of Saturn  internal vibrations resonate with orbits of particles in the C ring Gravitational resonances with ring particles sculpt waves and gaps in Saturn  rings Waves in the outer parts of the rings  specially the A ring and Cassini Division are shaped by gravitational resonances with the orbits of close n moons mostly Mimas Janus and Epimetheus closer to Saturn at the C and D rings it  the planet  uneven gravity that  doing the shaping Some of these waves move faster than the orbital speed of the ring particles That faster movement shows that the ring waves are sensitive to the planet  rotation NASA  JPL altech  SSI Panoramic scan across Saturn  rings  abeled From a vantage point above the ring plane Cassini scanned across the unlit side of Saturn  rings acquiring images through multiple color filters to make this approximately natural color panorama which shows details as small as 6 kilometers across  hich is much larger than any of the individual particles within the rings  Because the light is shining from the back of the rings toward Cassini parts of the rings that are mostly transparent but contain lots of fine dust like the F ring and the Cassini division are particularly bright Which one is the right number for Saturn  spin period 10  10  10  hours The radio erived numbers vary with time so it  tempting to say this newly erived number is the right answer But it  not time to update the textbooks just yet This paper hasn  been published yet it still needs to be picked at by other scientists who may find faults with it It would be nice to see another independent measure of the spin rate that found a result in agreement with this paper too As with any physics paper there are simplifying assumptions One major assumption as to do with the planet  rotation As the title of the paper suggests the work assumed that all of Saturn rotates at the same rate   that it  rotating as a rigid body Obviously this isn  true at the very topmost levels of the clouds but it  hard to know how deep Saturn  winds go  I wrote about this issue on Jupiter last year   In fact later on in the paper the authors show that there are some waves in the C ring that they still can  explain These not et xplained waves very likely have to do with differential rotation where Saturn  uppermost envelope may be rotating at a slightly faster speed than its interior I asked Mankovich on Twitter how it would likely affect their derivation of the rotation rate if Saturn did have differential rotation he replied that  f Saturn rotates on cylinders with a speedup toward the surface then we e under redicted the bulk rotation period  e are w rking on differential rotation now it seems that the median background rotation period is only likely to get longer by 2 minutes not enough to square with radio periods  Another set of assumptions had to do with the interior structure of Saturn something they had to assume in order to calculate its gravity A cool aspect of this work is that they were able to fine une their interior model of Saturn to match the C ring waves observed in Cassini images   that is they let the ring waves inform them about where Saturn  internal layers are They assumed a three ayered interior a dense rock ce core an inner envelope with a mixture of hydrogen elium and rock ce and an outer hydrogen elium envelope They allowed the proportion of materials in the inner envelope to vary as well as the partitioning of helium between the outer and inner envelopes  elium is heavier than hydrogen so it sinks there l be proportionally less helium in the outer envelope and more in the inner envelope  The observed ring waves pretty much require Saturn to have a substantial rocky core with a radius about 25 of Saturn  width or about 15 00 kilometers That would make its core about 15 to 20 Earth masses and it  consistent with the larger end of other workers estimates of Saturn  core size That  quite large   Saturn  rocky core is about as massive as the whole of planet Neptune The boundary between outer and inner envelopes isn  as well constrained there may be no sharp boundary anyway  Later on in our Twitter conversation Mankovich mentioned that Saturn might actually have a deep layer several thousand kilometers thick right above the core of nearly pure helium that has rained out of the gassy envelope That wasn  included in their model and might be important  eirdly the ice ock core might have started dissolving into this helium ich layer  So work remains to be done but I think it  pretty neat that the beautiful waves in Saturn  rings can tell us something about what the deep interior of the planet is doing NASA  JPL altech  SSI Resonances and plateaus in Saturn  C ring Saturn  C ring is home to a surprisingly rich array of structures and textures In this image a bright and narrow ringlet located toward the outer edge of the C ring is flanked by two broader features called plateaus each about 160 kilometers wide Plateaus are unique to the C ring Cassini data indicates that the plateaus do not necessarily contain more ring material than the C ring at large but the ring particles in the plateaus may be smaller enhancing their brightness This view looks toward the sunlit side of the rings from about 53 degrees above the ring plane The image was taken in green light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow ngle camera on 14 August 2017 I also think it  cool that I learned about this paper from Twitter Twitter has its issues but it  a great place to interact directly with scientists  bsp Read more Cassini  Voyager 1 and 2
