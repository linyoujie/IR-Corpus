 when was the first computer invented skip to main content search help tips dictionary history forums contact home history history q mp  when was the first computer invented updated 08 2 019 by computer hope there is no easy answer to this question due to the many different classifications of computers  the first mechanical computer created by charles babbage in 1822  doesn  really resemble what most would consider a computer today therefore this page provides a listing of each of the computer firsts starting with the difference engine and leading up to the computers we use today note early inventions which helped lead up to the computer such as the abacus  calculator  and tablet machines are not accounted for on this page when was the word  uot omputer uot was first used first mechanical computer or automatic computing engine concept first programmable computer first concepts of what we consider a modern computer the first electric programmable computer the first digital computer the first stored program computer the first computer company first computer with program stored in memory first commercial computer ibm 39  first computer the first computer with ram the first transistor computer the first minicomputer the first desktop and mass arket computer the first workstation the first microprocessor the first microcomputer the first personal computer the first laptop or portable computer the first apple computer the first ibm personal computer the first pc clone the first multimedia computer other computer company firsts when was the word  uot omputer uot was first used the word  uot omputer uot was first used in 1613 and originally described a human who performed calculations or computations the definition of a computer remained the same until the end of the 19th century when the industrial revolution gave rise to machines whose primary purpose was calculating first mechanical computer or automatic computing engine concept in 1822  charles babbage conceptualized and began developing the difference engine  considered to be the first automatic computing machine the difference engine was capable of computing several sets of numbers and making hard copies of the results babbage received some help with development of the difference engine from ada lovelace  considered by many to be the first computer programmer for her work and notes on the difference engine unfortunately because of funding babbage was never able to complete a full cale functional version of this machine in june 1991  the london science museum completed the difference engine no 2 for the bicentennial year of babbage 39  birth and later completed the printing mechanism in 2000 in 1837  charles babbage proposed the first general mechanical computer the analytical engine  the analytical engine contained an alu  arithmetic logic unit   basic flow control  punch cards  nspired by the jacquard loom   and integrated memory  it is the first general urpose computer concept unfortunately because of funding issues this computer was also never built while charles babbage was alive in 1910  henry babbage charles babbage 39  youngest son was able to complete a portion of this machine and was able to perform basic calculations first programmable computer the z1 was created by german konrad zuse in his parents 39 living room between 1936 and 1938 it is considered to be the first electromechanical binary programmable computer and the first really functional modern computer first concepts of what we consider a modern computer the turing machine was first proposed by alan turing in 1936 and became the foundation for theories about computing and computers the machine was a device that printed symbols on paper tape in a manner that emulated a person following a series of logical instructions without these fundamentals we wouldn 39  have the computers we use today the first electric programmable computer the colossus was the first electric programmable computer developed by tommy flowers  and was first demonstrated in december 1943  the colossus was created to help the british code breakers read encrypted german messages the first digital computer short for atanasoff erry computer  the abc began development by professor john vincent atanasoff and graduate student cliff berry in 1937  its development continued until 1942 at the iowa state college  ow iowa state university  the abc was an electrical computer that used more than 300 vacuum tubes for digital computation including binary math and boolean logic and had no cpu  as not programmable  on october 19 1973  us federal judge earl r larson signed his decision that the eniac patent by j presper eckert and john mauchly was invalid in the decision larson named atanasoff the sole inventor the eniac was invented by j presper eckert and john mauchly at the university of pennsylvania and began construction in 1943 and was not completed until 1946  it occupied about 1 00 square feet and used about 18 00 vacuum tubes weighing almost 50 tons although the judge ruled that the abc computer was the first digital computer many still consider the eniac to be the first digital computer because it was fully functional the first stored program computer the first computer to electronically store and execute a program was the ssem  mall cale experimental machine  also known as the  uot aby uot or  uot anchester baby quot in 1948  it was designed by frederic williams  and built by his prot acute  acute  tom kilburn  with the assistance of geoff tootill at the university of manchester england kilburn wrote the first electronically tored program which finds the highest proper factor of an integer  using repeated subtraction rather than division kilburn 39  program was executed on june 21 1948  the second stored rogram computer was also british the edsac  built and designed by maurice wilkes at the university of cambridge mathematical laboratory in england the edsac performed its first calculation on may 6 1949  it was also the first computer to run a graphical computer game  uot xo quot an implementation of tic ac oe displayed on a 6 nch cathode ray tube  around the same time the manchester mark 1 was another computer that could run stored programs built at the victoria university of manchester the first version of the mark 1 computer became operational in april 1949  mark 1 was used to run a program to search for mersenne primes for nine hours without error on june 16 and 17 that same year the first computer company the first computer company was the electronic controls company and was founded in 1949 by j presper eckert and john mauchly the same individuals who helped create the eniac computer the company was later renamed to emcc or eckert auchly computer corporation and released a series of mainframe computers under the univac name first computer with program stored in memory first delivered to the united states government in 1950  the univac 1101 or era 1101 is considered to be the first computer capable of storing and running a program from memory first commercial computer in 1942 konrad zuse begin working on the z4 that later became the first commercial computer the computer was sold to eduard stiefel a mathematician of the swiss federal institute of technology zurich on july 12 1950  ibm 39

perotto and manufactured by olivetti about 44 00 programma 101 computers were sold each with a price tag of   00 in 1968  hewlett packard began marketing the hp 9100a  considered to be the first mass arketed desktop computer the first workstation although it was never sold the first workstation is considered to be the xerox alto  introduced in 1974 the computer was revolutionary for its time and included a fully functional computer display and mouse  the computer operated like many computers today utilizing windows  menus and icons as an interface to its operating system many of the computer 39  capabilities were first demonstrated in the mother of all demos by douglas engelbart on december 9 1968 the first microprocessor intel introduces the first microprocessor the intel 4004 on november 15 1971 the first microcomputer the vietnamese rench engineer andr acute truong trong thi along with francois gernelle developed the micral computer in 1973  considered as the first
