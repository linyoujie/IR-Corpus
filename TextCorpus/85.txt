jordan rice    published monday august 8 2016 minutephysics as most people know the sun is a much more complicated celestial object than the earth or any of the other planets therefore the simple question of  dquo ow long is a day on the sun dquo does not possess such a straightforward answer as shown in this video by minutephysics  it depends on what one is looking for in a day to determine how long it might actually be the easiest answer is that of a sidereal day a day in which the stars are the time keepers a star can be found at one location in the sky one night and then the time it takes to find the star in that same position the next night is a sidereal day for earth that is about 23 hours and 56 minutes or 24 hours if you round up but even this solution to the question depends on where one is standing on the sun as different parts of the sun rotate at different speeds at the equator it would take approximately 24  earth days while at the poles about 34 earth days  bsp one can also factor in time dilation as one day on earth  6 00 seconds would be one day plus some change  6 00  seconds on the sun due to the fact that the sun is much more massive than the earth it is really up to you to decide what answer seems the most logical as this video illustrates nbsp 0 join the discussion read and share your comments on this article related articles nasa wants you to
