in his own lifetime he discovered the laws of gravity and motion and invented calculus He helped to shape our rational world view But Newton's story is also one of a monstrous ego who believed that he alone was able to understand God's creation His private life was far from rational – consumed by petty jealousies bitter rivalries and a ruthless quest for reputation 25 December 1642 Not expected to survive the day Newton was born prematurely on Christmas morning in Woolsthorpe Lincolnshire He was a tiny baby given little chance of survival The country he was born into was chaotic and turbulent England was being torn apart by civil war Plague was an ever resent threat Many believed the end of the world was imminent But the hamlet of Woolsthorpe was a quiet community little touched by either war or plague which respected Puritan values of sobriety simple worship and hard work Newton x27  childhood home of Woolsthorpe Manor Lincolnshire 1645 A lonely boy who hated his stepfather Newton's father had died before he was born When Isaac was three his mother left him with his grandmother and married a man from a nearby village This turbulent start scarred Newton for life He felt rejected by his family He hated his stepfather and threatened to burn his house down At Grantham school Newton sought solace in books He was unmoved by literature and poetry but loved mechanics and technology inventing an elaborate system of sundials which was accurate to the minute While his mother hoped he would run the family farm his uncle and his headmaster realised Newton was destined for an intellectual life Newton x27  childhood home of Woolsthorpe Manor Lincolnshire 1661 A mathematical mentor Newton enrolled at Trinity College Cambridge Here he found a father figure who set him on the road to important discoveries Isaac Barrow Cambridge x27  first professor of mathematics steered Newton away from the standard undergraduate texts and towards the big unsolved mathematical problems of the day such as calculus  a way of describing how things change Calculus would later be crucial for explaining the universe in mathematical terms Newton also hunted out new works by men such as Descartes who argued that the Universe was governed by mechanical laws What did Newton's professors teach him – and why did he reject it Clip from Isaac Newton The Last Magician  BC Two  1665 Newton's productive plague years When Cambridge University was closed because of the plague Newton was forced to return home This was the most productive period of his life Newton was driven by the belief that the path to true knowledge lay in making observations rather than reading books For example rather than trust texts on optics he experimented by sticking a bodkin – a blunt needle – in his eye to see its effect He laid the groundwork for his theories of calculus and laws of motion that would later make him famous But naturally secretive he kept his ideas to himself See some of the remarkable ideas Newton conceived during this period of isolation Clip from Isaac Newton The Last Magician  BC Two  1671 New ideas lead to a revolutionary new telescope Newton continued to experiment in his laboratory This mix of theory and practice led him to many different kinds of discoveries His theory of optics made him reconsider the design of the telescope which up until this point was a large cumbersome instrument By using mirrors instead of lenses Newton was able to create a more powerful instrument 10 times smaller than traditional telescopes When the Royal Society heard about Newton's telescope they were impressed This gave Newton the courage to tell them what he described as a'crucial experiment' about light and colours Watch this clip to find out how Newton x27  telescope works Clip from Isaac Newton The Last Magician  BC Two  1672 Taking criticism badly The Royal Society was an elite group who met to share and critique each other's work They encouraged Newton to share his ideas But Newton x27  theories about light did not go down well Other members of the Royal Society could not reproduce his results – partly because Newton had described his experiment in an obscure manner Newton did not take the criticism well When Robert Hooke challenged Newton's letters on light and colours he made a lifelong enemy Newton had an ugly temper and an unshakable conviction that he was right With his pride dented he began to withdraw from intellectual life The Royal Society met at Crane Court It was a newly formed organisation for men of learning to discuss their ideas 1679 A self mposed exile Smarting from criticism Newton isolated himself from other natural philosophers and dedicated himself to radical religious and alchemical work With his mother on her deathbed he returned home to Woolsthorpe and embarked on a period of solitary study He became absorbed in alchemy a secretive study of the nature of life and the medieval forerunner of chemistry Some argue that these ideas while not scientific in the sense that we understand them now helped him think radical thoughts that shaped his most important work including his theories of gravity In the 17th Century alchemists searched for the philosopher's stone and the elixir of life and attempted to turn ordinary metals into gold 1684 Newton x27  greatest rivalry begins When German philosopher Gottfried Leibniz published an important mathematical paper it was the beginning of a lifelong feud between the two men Leibniz one of Europe's most prominent philosophers had set his mind to one of the trickiest problems in mathematics – the way equations could describe the physical world Like Newton he created a new theory of calculus However Newton claimed he x27  done the same work 20 years before and that Leibniz had stolen his ideas But the secretive Newton hadn x27  published his work and had to hastily return to his old notes so the world could see his workings  Gottfried Leibniz was one of the leading philosophers in Europe and quickly made an enemy in Newton 1687 The Principia Mathematica A foundation of modern science Challenged by Robert Hooke to prove his theories about planetary orbits Newton produced what is considered the foundation for physics as we know it The Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica took Newton two years to write It was the culmination of more than 20 years of thinking It outlined his own theory of calculus the three laws of motion and the first rigorous account of his theory of universal gravitation Together this provided a revolutionary new mathematical description of the Universe The work cemented his reputation and contains much of what he is remembered for today Find out the reaction to the publication of Newton's Principia Clip from Isaac Newton The Last Magician  BC Two  1689 Newton enters the world of politics Having made his name as a natural philosopher Newton was attracted to a new life as a politician and public figure Profoundly religious Newton could not sit by while James II attempted to re atholicise Cambridge University – even if it meant nailing his own religious colours to the mast He successfully fought James x27  reforms and got himself elected as a Member of Parliament However he made little impact in the Commons and appears on record only to ask for a window to be closed The coronation of James II at Westminster Hall Newton fought the new king over religious reforms at Cambridge University 1693 Exhaustion and breakdown In mid 693 Newton suffered a mental collapse when he suspected that his friends were conspiring against him After working five nights in a row Newton suffered what we might describe as a nervous breakdown He later apologised to the philosopher John Locke and to the MP Samuel Pepys for having wished them dead though whether he actually wished this is unclear Yet Newton x27  fragile mental health did not dent his public reputation He was soon offered an important new post Somewhere around his 50th birthday Newton suffered what we would now term a severe nervous breakdown 1696 Newton saves Britain x27  currency As warden of the Royal Mint Newton found a new calling He attempted to make Britain x27  currency the most stable in the world In the 17th Century Britain x27  finances were in crisis One in every 10 coins was forged and often the metal in a coin was worth more than the face value of the coin itself Newton oversaw a huge project to recall the old currency and issue a more reliable one Always methodical Newton kept a database of counterfeiters and prosecuted them with a puritanical fury He was appointed Master of the Mint in 1700 and held the post for the rest of his life In the 18th Century the Royal Mint was located within the Tower of London Newton was master for nearly 30 years 1703 Newton elected president of the Royal Society As the leading figure in British natural philosophy Newton had completed his most important work Now he set about securing his reputation Newton was an imposing leader obsessed by power and reputation Though he continued to publish his own work he also worked to make and break the reputations of other men He tried to write Hooke out of history and began another bitter dispute with astronomer John Flamsteed by publishing Flamsteed x27  catalogue of stars without his consent Newton remained an influential figure surrounded by a new generation of students brought up on his ideas How did Newton use his power to cement his reputation Clip from Isaac Newton The Last Magician  BC Two  1712 Newton re rites history in his favour Newton and Leibniz had quarrelled over who invented calculus Now Newton saw a way to triumph over his intellectual nemesis In 1713 the Royal Society formed a committee to decide once and for all who invented calculus It found that Newton had beaten Leibniz by many years However the secret author of the Royal Society report was none other than Newton himself Leibniz refused to concede defeat and the feud only ended once both men were dead Today it is accepted that both men arrived at the calculus independently Newton  eft and Leibniz  ight were lifelong enemies 1726 Newton creates a legend At the very end of his life Newton told a story which has become one of the most enduring legends in the history of science Dining with fellow Royal Society member William Stukeley Newton remembered that he had been sitting beneath an apple tree at his family home of Woolsthorpe and a falling apple had prompted him to think about gravity The story was also told by other people who knew Newton including his niece Catherine who cared for him in his later years However the myth that Newton was hit on the head by the apple was a later invention The story of the falling apple has became part of the mythology that surrounds Newton as Robert Hannah x27  19th Century portrait shows 20th March 1727 Newton dies Newton died aged 84 and was buried with full honours in Westminster Abbey As a celebrated natural philosopher he was a new kind of national hero Newton laid the foundations for our scientific age His laws of motion and theory of gravity underpin much of modern physics and engineering Yet he had believed he was put on Earth to decode the word of God by studying both the scriptures and the book of nature For him theology and mathematics were part of one project to discover a single system of the world  uot ere lies that which was mortal of Isaac Newton uot  the Newton memorial at Westminster Abbey Explore the BBC Home
