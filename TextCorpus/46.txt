in Omaha on Monday Credit  Z Long maha World erald via Associated Press By The New York Times Published Feb 3 2020 Updated Feb 17 2020 The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the United States nearly doubled on Monday after federal officials announced that 14 Americans evacuated from a cruise ship in Japan and flown back to this country had tested positive for the virus That brought the number of known cases in this country to 29 Though the vast majority of coronavirus cases have been in China where more than 1 00 people have died and thousands more have been diagnosed public health officials in the United States are racing to stop the virus from spreading widely in this country Flights have been canceled Travelers have been quarantined on military bases Plans have been upended Here's what we know about those patients 14 Americans who tested positive were flown to the U  The largest single group of Americans with the virus was flown to the United States in two chartered flights on Monday and officials said they were being placed in isolation to receive medical attention The passengers were among more than 300 Americans flown back to this country after being aboard a cruise ship that had been quarantined in Yokohama Japan for more than 10 days U  officials initially said that they would not allow infected people to board the evacuation flights but they appeared to reverse that decision early Monday"During the evacuation process after passengers had disembarked the ship and initiated transport to the airport U  officials received notice that 14 passengers who had been tested 2  days earlier had tested positive for COVID 9  the State Department and Department of Health and Human Services said in a joint statement referring to the disease caused by the new coronavirus The infected passengers — who officials said were asymptomatic and"fit to fly" — were moved into a specialized containment area on the evacuation aircraft where they were to be isolated and monitored during the flights Get an informed guide to the global outbreak with our daily Coronavirus newsletter The two planes landed early Monday one at Travis Air Force Base in Fairfield Calif

tested positive for the virus Two were being held as part of a federally andated 14 ay quarantine at a military base in San Diego and a third was in quarantine at the San Antonio base Hundreds of people — mostly Americans — have been evacuated from Wuhan since Jan 29 and kept on five military bases in Nebraska Texas and California for 14 days The two people who were found to have coronavirus in San Diego had no apparent connection They arrived on different planes and were housed in separate facilities on the same base according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention At least one of them a woman had been released from a hospital and returned to the military base after officials erroneously reported that she had been cleared in testing for the virus Officials blamed mislabeling of a testing sample for the error and the woman was later found to have tested positive for coronavirus and returned to the hospital"At this time there is no indication of person o erson
