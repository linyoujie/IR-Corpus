jeremiah budi n november 24 2018 facebook twitter email print save story facebook twitter email print save story photograph from time life pictures  mansell  getty gottfried leibniz mathematician  when isaac first explained his theory of gravity to me i remember being impressed not by the theory which as far as i could tell was basically that stuff falls down but definitely by the name gravity  that 's got a ring to it it 's punchy i knew it would be a success edmond halley astronomer  isaac is an absolute genius when it comes to branding i mean we all knew that stuff falls down he didn 't exactly come up with that but he was the first guy who really sold it and the story about the apple falling out of the tree that was a nice touch voltaire writer  i could have discovered gravity do you think an apple has never fallen out of a tree and hit me on the head before guess what—that happens to me all of the time big deal leibniz  i have to admit even i was surprised by how fast gravity caught on i still don 't completely understand it not the theory—i definitely understand the theory which is again very simple i just don 't understand how it became such a phenomenon but whatever people like what they like halley  look i get it isaac 's theory of gravity was more accessible than some of my stuff i 'm more of a scientist 's scientist it 's nice that he found such a big audience but that 's not everybody 's primary goal voltaire  let me explain something to you i have an apple tree in my back yard under which i frequently sit it is a terrible tree it has a disease or something apples are constantly dropping down right onto my head i hate that tree what were we talking about again oh right newton that guy 's a hack leibniz  i noticed that isaac started doing this thing at parties where he would go up to people and introduce himself as "isaac newton the gravity guy  and then he would do this little shrug like he was embarrassed it always made my skin crawl halley  if he 'd gone around calling himself "isaac newton the guy who noticed that stuff falls down " he probably wouldn 't have gotten as much attention but it 's all about networking and putting yourself out there and let 's just say that there 's a certain type of person who intrinsically understands that leibniz  i don 't want to come across like i 'm jealous or anything i 'm not i invented the pinwheel calculator which people are probably going to be using for centuries to come so we both have our things it 's fine halley  did you know that i funded his research for the three universal laws of motion how the hell did he talk me into giving him money for that the guy is a snake charmer i mean look at this crap "an object at rest stays at rest and an object in motion stays in motion  so basically things stay the way they are unless something changes great very good very specific discovery thank you for letting us know isaac voltaire  i actually had my own discovery relating to apples which was that when an apple falls out of a tree and hits you on the head juice comes out of the apple to me that seems more interesting than whatever newton was talking about leibniz  also we both invented calculus independently of each other and he accused me of plagiarism but let 's not get into that right now again it 's fine and i am fine halley  i guess maybe i wasn 't clear on the rules for what exactly constitutes a discovery like it can be anything you just say something you see and give it a catchy name and then everybody hails you as a genius "hey i just came up with a new law it 's called the law of    tables it states that a table will remain a table unless it gets broken or something  wow so smart leibniz  did i mention that i invented the pinwheel calculator make sure you include that in whatever this is voltaire  the first time an apple hit me on the head i guess i was around seven years old someone threw a rotten apple out of a window and—blam and that has happened to me at least once a week ever since it is my curse and i 'm pretty sure it 's somehow isaac newton 's fault halley  i discovered a fucking comet that 's a discovery isaac newton discoverer of gravity  you were talking to whom oh yeah i remember them we used to do science together back when i was coming up whatever happened to those guys more humor satire isaac newton voltaire gravity
