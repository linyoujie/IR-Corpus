extremely interesting read reviewed in the united states on october 19 2017 format paperback verified purchase although i come from an engineering background and hence am a little skeptical of other than mainstream concepts i will admit that i have always harbored a belief that much of what we consider  34 istory 34 is highly pasteurized with all due respect to serious historians theories as complex as how why and why people came to the americas need input from all available sources to be comprehensible not just the facts that support for instance beringia or clovis points of view mr menzies has done a great job collecting scientific research  lthough he isn  reluctant to include some anecdotal information as well as his own significant contribution in making sense of all the disparate information that doesn  fit the prevailing theories this is an extremely interesting book for the amateur history buff like myself even if you don  necessarily agree with all of his conclusions read more 20 people found this helpful helpful sending feedback  thank you for your feedback sorry we failed to record your vote please try again comment report abuse woody 5  out of 5 stars just part of the story  reviewed in the united states on february 16 2015 format kindle edition verified purchase first of all gavin menzies knows what he  talking about however i was a little disappointed in that it dealt primarily with the ancient findings in chile which is very important but i was hoping he would cover more territory most writers of pre istory ignore that the earliest archeological findings in america will never be found because they are covered by up to 300 feet of water off the present west coast of america you must remember that the ocean levels were much lower 12k to 30k years ago and as such peoples coasting from asia across beringia to america left their traces on land that is now under water the clovis people were not the first peoples in the new world as menzies shows in this book but the whole story may never be known unless serious underwater archeology is attempted read more 29 people found this helpful helpful sending feedback  thank you for

kindle edition verified purchase i read about 1  of "who discovered america  before i quit life is too short to spend my time reading a bad book when gavin menzies isn 't twisting facts to fit his

out of 5 stars fun read reviewed in the united states on january 10 2017 format kindle edition verified purchase this book was a fun read but i don  think i  recommend using it as a valid source for serious research archeologists are a rather tunnel isioned group as a whole but the  34 vidence 34 presented here seemed rather far etched with little tangible proof and lots of assumptions that the

in the united states on november 5 2018 format kindle edition verified purchase he doesn  do any real research just visits archaeological sites for an hour or two and comes away thinking that makes him an expert his reasoning is also clearly off stone age peoples couldn  have migrated by land bridge across the bering straits because he ran out of gas and couldn  drive across he also discounts their ability to survive the environment because he doesn  know how he would find food and keep warm get over yourself i stopped reading because i was afraid the junk would pollute my mind and pop up

brilliant and factual  a must for those who were taught of columbus vasco da gama  eric the red and more   have one slight reservation  omment and that is  r menzies as with his other excellent books has uncovered so much new stuff and made so many links between discoveries from widely separated parts of the globe that sometimes his enthusiasm gets in the way of the readability but that is a comment  and the book is terrific nice to see an untrained but meticulous and dogged researcher  xplorer finding such links of course by his discoveries he has often upset the conventional wisdom of the alleged professionals all those letters after their names  and university dollars behind them they of course don  want to own up to missing things let alone to being plain wrong  hence menzies anxiety to get his information over i could imagine he  a nightmare to work with  ut brilliant at what he does support him get the book  all of them  and be amazed read more 8 people found this

united kingdom on january 11 2014 format kindle edition verified purchase i have enjoyed gavin menzies previous books and this one did not disappoint either in this book gavin sums up conclusions and hypotheses he  come to about areas of the americas that he feels have been influenced by or even settled by early asian explorers there is a melancholy in this work because he indicates this may be his last book i don  know if all of his assumptions are true and he himself is very clear about the fact that he would welcome more research but menzies is no von daniken he is inviting us to think beyond the eurocentric acount of world history that many of us have grown up with and i applaud him for it i can also see how irritating this can be to academic historians who have to be so careful not to trash their own reputations and risk their funding by saying anything controversial but that is not gavin menzies problem it is a problem that pervades the world of academia mr menzies invites us to think outside of the box of established world history and i hope others will follow in his footsteps read more 9 people found this helpful helpful sending feedback  thank you for your feedback
