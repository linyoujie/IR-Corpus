consider the 1970 's to be the first time in history a computer was created and made available for purchase this is the first time personal computers were available to the general public but it 's definitely not the first time a computer was built and created in order to serve the general public in september 1956 ibm launched the first computer with magnetic disc storage or what is more well nown as a hard disc drive  dd  the 305 ramac  andom access method of accounting and control weighed over 2000 pounds cost  5 00 a year to operate and only stored 5 mb  ega ytes of data it could be leased to businesses for   00 per month in 1957 over one thousand of these systems were manufactured between 1957  1961  when ibm announced the availability of this massive machine they released a film which chronicled the 5 year journey from research and development to the creation of th 305 ramac the film was used to pitch this brand new machine to the modern ay business offering to make the burdening task of data storage data retrieval and mathematical functions a thing of the past ibm emphasized such features as "recording transactions as they occur " and "processing amazing speed and unrelated data randomly retrieved and randomly transacted " the vast amount of storage the 305 aramac was able to create was compared to the ability of the current punch card system this contemporary computer of the times could collect and store as much as "32 cartons containing 64 00 ibm punch cards " chrysler was the first company to purchase and use the 305 ramac it was installed at their motor and parts division  opar and replaced a punch card storage structure that maintained their inventory control and order processing system ibm also provided a 305 ramac for the 1960 olympic winter games held in squaw valley usa  ibm punch card system why was this so fascinating to the world the 305 ramac was the first machine that allowed data to be stored and retrieved almost immediately this is why it was marketed strictly as a business machine at that time most businesses kept track of all their data  payroll records accounting records inventory budgets and general business information  on good old ashioned paper filed and organized in a structure best suited to the management of the business it 's pretty obvious that with this type of system one could spend hours sorting through organized files trying to find the one piece of information that was needed a hard drive allowed for the immediate retrieval of information this was a huge technical advancement and would have astronomical effects on the future of data storage a 1998 article in the electronic engineering times describes the release of the 305 ramac by ibm it started with a product announcement in may of 1955 ibm corp was introducing a product that offered unprecedented random ccess storage â€” 5 million characters  ot bytes they were 7 it not 8 it characters  this first disk drive heralded startling leaps in mass torage technology and the end of sequential storage on punched cards and paper or mylar tape though magnetic tape would continue for archival or backup storage the disk drive was big not quite ready for today 's laptop with its vacuum ube control electronics the ramac  or "random ccess method of accounting and control " occupied the space of two refrigerators and weighed a ton it stored those 5 million characters on 50 hefty aluminum disks coated on both sides with a magnetic iron oxide a variation of the paint primer used for the golden gate bridge the ibm 350 disc storage or hard drive inside the 305 ramac contained 50 vertically stacked 24 nch hard discs and used up 16 square feet of space inside the computer data was stored and retrieved by use of an access arm while the aluminum discs spun at speeds of 1 00 rpm if you were to compare the 1956 305 ramac to today 's computers you would see a dramatic difference in volume of data stored and size of the machine the original iphone in 2007 included up to 8 gb of storage and weighed under one pound a device weighing less than a pound could store approximately 8000 mb of data that is 1600 times more storage than the 305 ramac in a computer the size of two refrigerators you could have stored one individual iphone picture in fact an original 1956 ramac is on display today at the computer history museum in mountain view
