late 1960s and early 1970s landed the first humans on the moon  Astronauts haven pos  returned in more than 46 years  But NASA hopes to send robots there by 2022 followed by crewed missions in 2024 Here pos  a list of every Apollo mission and the highlights of what each one accomplished Visit Business Insider pos  homepage for more stories  Fifty years ago this month humans stepped onto the moon for the first time in history On July 16 1969 the crew of NASA pos  Apollo 11 mission  x2014 astronauts Neil Armstrong Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins  x2014 launched on a daring adventure Four days later on July 20 Armstrong and Aldrin landed a small spaceship on the lunar surface crawled outside and planted their boots into the ground along with an American flag and some scientific instruments Apollo 11 often hogs the history books but many Apollo missions before it made the astronauts pos conquest possible and the missions that followed added to the program pos  long list of accomplishments In total NASA wound up putting 12 astronauts on the moon pos  surface  In the roughly five decades since then however no US spacecraft has returned with people That may soon change though Read more  An astronaut explains why the Apollo 11 moon landing was not the NASA program pos  greatest moment In March Vice President Mike Pence vowed that the US would put astronauts back on the moon by 2024 The first year of the program may cost    billion  and the goal is to eventually build a permanent lunar base mine ice from craters  and split that water into fuel for more ambitious space exploration like crewed visits to Mars In November 2018 NASA also announced that it was offering up to    billion in contracts to nine American companies that could land robotic probes on the moon by 2022 NASA does not want to buy the lunar landers or take responsibility for launching landing or controlling them Instead the space agency wants the private sector to deal with those challenges and bid on the opportunity to take NASA pos  experiments to the moon NASA has since selected demonstration payloads that could go to the moon as part of that program  x2014 perhaps even by the end of this year Until new moon missions take off here pos  a look back at all of NASA pos  Apollo missions which flew between 1968 and 1972 and succeeded in putting the first humans on the moon The Apollo 1 mission was designed to launch a spacecraft into low arth orbit But it ended in tragedy when a fire killed three astronauts in their spaceship during a routine pre aunch test From left Apollo 1 astronauts Virgil  uot us uot Grissom Edward White and Roger Chaffee pose in front of their Saturn 1 launch vehicle at the Kennedy Space Center The three astronauts died in a fatal fire during a routine test NASA Thick smoke filled the crew module of the Apollo 1 capsule on January 27 1967 Three NASA astronauts  x2014 Virgil  uot us uot Grissom Roger Chaffee and Edward White  x2014 were inside performing a routine test and were unable to open the hatch in time to escape the fire  A0 Emergency rescue teams rushed to the launchpad  ocated where the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station is today  but they were too late  A0 An investigation revealed several issues with the capsule pos  design including an electrical wiring problem and flammable materials inside the crew cabin On the 50th anniversary of Apollo 1 pos  fatal fire NASA displayed the hatch at the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex  A0 The deadly fire led NASA to postpone other planned crewed launches No missions were labeled Apollo 2 or 3 The charred interior of the Apollo 1 spacecraft after the flash fire that killed astronauts Ed White Roger Chaffee and Virgil Grissom This severely damaged area is most likely where the blaze ignited AP In the spring of 1967 NASA announced it would keep the designation of Apollo 1 for the mission that never occurred The rocket meant for Apollo 1 was later reassembled and used to launch Apollo 5  A0 The Apollo 4 5 and 6 missions launched no astronauts but were critical in paving the way for crewed missions They occurred between November 1967 and April 1968 The Apollo 4 mission launched from Launch Complex 39 at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida NASA Apollo 4 which launched on November 9 1967 was the first uncrewed test flight of NASA pos  Saturn V rocket which was developed to bring astronauts to the moon  A0 The mission was the first ver launch from the Kennedy Space Center It was a success for NASA as it proved that Saturn V worked At the time the 363 oot all vehicle was the largest spacecraft to ever attempt flight  A0 Apollo 5 launched a few months later on January 22 1968 The mission successfully tested the ability of the Apollo Lunar Module  x2014 the spacecraft designed to land on the moon pos  surface  x2014 to perform descent and ascent maneuvers The Apollo 6 launch followed on April 4 1968 The mission aimed to show that the Saturn V rocket was capable of trans unar injection which puts a spacecraft on its path to the moon But the system quickly ran into problems  Two of the five engines shut down unexpectedly and the spacecraft could not propel itself into orbit Despite the issues with Apollo 6 NASA pushed ahead with plans for its first crewed launch Apollo 7 launched on October 11 1968 and it was the first crewed test of the spaceship that was built to orbit the moon It was also the first live V broadcast of Americans in space The expended Saturn S VB stage as seen from the Apollo 7 spacecraft during transposition and docking maneuvers on October 11 1968 NASA The Apollo 7 crew comprised of astronauts Walter Schirra Donn Eisele and Walter Cunningham achieved the original goal of Apollo 1 launching a spacecraft with people inside into low arth orbit Schirra Eisele and Cunningham spent more than 10 days in space while orbiting Earth 163 times At the time t hat was more time in space than all of the previous Soviet missions combined according to the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum  To lower the risk of a cabin fire during liftoff NASA designed the command module pos  atmosphere to have 60 oxygen and 40 nitrogen   higher percentage of oxygen would have increased the risk  The cabin atmosphere gradually adjusted to pure oxygen shortly after liftoff On Christmas Eve of 1968 Apollo 8 astronauts Jim Lovell William Anders and Frank Borman became the first people to orbit the moon Earthrise as seen from the Apollo 8 mission NASA The purpose of the Apollo 8 mission was to study and take pictures of the moon pos  surface  A0 In addition to achieving a historic and important space ravel milestone Apollo 8 also became known for the famous  uot arthrise uot photo that the astronauts captured  A0 It was the first time humans saw what our planet looks like from space a moment that one Apollo ra astronaut describes as humanity pos   uot osmic birth uot as space travellers Earthrise has become one of the most reproduced space photos in history appearing on posters US postage stamps and even Time magazine pos  cover in 1969  xA0 The Apollo 9 mission stayed in low arth orbit and tested all the major components that would be essential for a lunar landing It featured the first crewed test of the spacecraft designed to land on the moon Apollo 9 astronaut Russell Schweickart lunar module pilot operates a 70mm Hasselblad camera during his extravehicular activity on March 6 1969 NASA Apollo 9 launched on March 3 1969 carrying astronauts James McDivitt David Scott and Russell Schweickart After a successful 10 ay mission the astronauts splashed down into the Atlantic Ocean Apollo 10 the first of three crewed moon missions that took place in 1969 was described as a  uot ress rehearsal uot for the first lunar landing Astronaut Eugene Cernan leaves the Apollo 10 spacecraft during recovery operations in the South Pacific on May 26 1969 Already in the life raft are astronauts Thomas Stafford and John Young NASA Astronauts John Young Thomas Stafford and Eugene Cernan launched atop a Saturn V rocket on May 18 1969 The men came closer to the lunar surface  xA0 han any astronaut before them Young Stafford and Cernan also got farther from Earth than anybody before The Apollo 10 mission included a test of a lunar lander that was similar to the one later used for the first moon landing The lander named Snoopy was designed to travel most of the way down to the surface  ut not all the way so the astronauts could test its performance and use it to survey the future landing site Stafford and Cernan successfully piloted Snoopy to about 50 00 feet above the moon pos  surface before returning to the main spaceship where Young had remained  A0 An estimated 530 million people around the world watched as Apollo 11 astronaut Neil Armstrong became the first person to step foot on the moon on July 20 1969 The astronauts placed an American flag on the moon's surface during a television broadcast of the event NASA Armstrong famously called the historic achievement a  uot iant leap for mankind quot Buzz Aldrin followed him onto the lunar surface while their crew mate Michael Collins stayed on the main spacecraft in orbit around the moon After the three astronauts returned to Earth they were quarantined for 21 days to make sure they did not bring home any lunar contagions Armstrong turned 39 during the confinement Until the Apollo 11 mission Russian cosmonauts had been ahead of the US at almost every turn in the Cold War space race At the time many Americans did not believe spending  4  billion on the Apollo missions was worth it and some people protested NASA pos  eight ear effort to land on the moon Newly publicized documents suggest today that a once lassified anomaly risked killing the Apollo 11 crew during their return to Earth Astronauts had other near eath experiences in the years leading up to the moon landing too In March 1966 Armstrong and co ilot David Scott were almost lost in space during the Gemini 8 mission This was the first attempt to dock one spacecraft with another while in orbit an essential step in a moon landing But soon after takeoff a thruster malfunctioned which sent Armstrong and Scott spinning out of control Luckily they found a way to regain control of the spacecraft by powering thrusters A few months after Armstrong and Aldrin walked on the moon NASA sent another spacecraft to the lunar surface in the Apollo 12 mission Apollo 12 launches in stormy weather NASA The Apollo 12 mission was neither as historic as its predecessor nor as scary as the near isaster of Apollo 13 But Apollo 12 was not without drama The mission which launched on November 14 1969 was almost aborted minutes of takeoff because lightning struck the spacecraft and scrambled the rocket pos  instruments Many of the instruments were disabled completely after a second lightning strike At the time NASA was unsure whether the mission could safely continue But the mission wound up being successful  x2014 a stronauts Charles Conrad and Alan Bean landed on the lunar surface while Richard Gordon circled the moon   A0  xA0 The Apollo 13 mission blasted off from the Kennedy Space Center on April 11 1970 but things went terribly wrong about 56 hours into the trip to the moon Seated from left to right director of flight crew operations Donald Slayton spacecraft communicator Jack Lousma and Apollo 13 backup crew commander John Young in the Mission Control Center Several hours earlier on April 13 1970 crew members of the Apollo 13 mission had reported trouble NASA An oxygen tank exploded and damaged the cabin of the spaceship that housed a stronauts Fred Haise Jack Swigert and Jim Lovell The blast caused the spacecraft to lose its ability to generate water and power within three hours of this malfunction and the astronauts pos oxygen stores were lost too The lunar module which was supposed to land two of the men on the moon became the astronauts pos  uot ifeboat uot as they abandoned the main spaceship But that small spacecraft was only built for two people so the lithium hydroxide canisters that absorbed carbon dioxide gas from the air were used up quickly The astronauts were at risk of dying from high levels of the gas but managed to retrofit the main ship pos  gas bsorbing canisters to fit into openings on the lunar module They circled the moon but did not attempt the landing that had been planned The crew landed safely in the South Pacific on April 17 1970 and NASA called the mission a  uot uccessful failure  quot Read more The transcript from the Apollo 13 disaster will give you chills NASA made another successful lunar landing the following year Apollo 14 astronauts Alan Shepard Edgar Mitchell and Stuart Roosa launched from the Kennedy Space Center on January 31 1971 A close p view of a large boulder located on the rim of Cone Crater as photographed by the crew members of Apollo 14 on February 6 1971 NASA The spacecraft pos  destination was the same as the aborted Apollo 13 mission pos  the moon pos  Fra Mauro highlands  A0 Apollo 14 collected more lunar material and data than originally planned to make up for Apollo 13 pos  failure to reach the moon pos  surface Astronauts used a wheeled Lunar Roving Vehicle for the first time during the Apollo 15 mission to study the moon

NASA NASA astronauts David Scott James Irwin and Alfred Worden made up the Apollo 15 crew Using a vehicle helped Scott and Irwin to travel farther from the lunar lander than others before them The samples that the Apollo 15 astronauts brought back included a rock estimated to be 4 billion years old  A0 Apollo 15 along with the two missions that followed it featured a television camera on the lunar rover an updated lunar module that let crews stay on the moon for longer than before and redesigned backpacks that let astronauts spend more time on the lunar surface  A0 NASA used the Apollo 16 mission to explore the moon x27  highlands for the first time Astronaut Charles Duke lunar module pilot of the Apollo 16 mission is photographed collecting lunar samples at Station No 1 during the first Apollo 16 extravehicular activity at the Descartes landing site NASA Astronauts John Young Thomas Mattingly and Charles Duke comprised the crew On April 20 1972 36 ear ld Duke became the youngest human in history to walk on the lunar surface Duke also made headlines for leaving a photo of him his two sons and his wife on the moon  uot  pos  always planned to leave it on the moon quot Duke previously told Business Insider   uot o when I dropped it it was just to show the kids that I really did leave it on the moon quot After more than 20 hours of experiments on the lunar surface Young and Duke collected roughly 210 pounds of samples But Duke said he had a brush with death while trying to pull off a  uot oon Olympics uot high jump  xA0 n the lunar surface  uot  learned a

to the United States flag on the lunar surface in December 1972 NASA Apollo 17 commander Eugene Cernan is still the last person  xA0 o walk on the lunar surface Compared to previous missions this trip collected the most rock and soil samples from the moon During the Apollo 15 and 17 missions astronauts also installed heat low experiments to gather data on the moon pos  temperature Earlier this year a study published in the Journal of Geophysical Research analyzed that data and concluded that NASA astronauts likely warmed up the moon pos  surface temperature by as much as 6 degrees Fahrenheit by walking around According to the study walking on the moon and driving rovers around caused dark moon dust called regolith to be exposed  This likely prompted the moon pos  surface to heat up the scientists said because darker materials absorb more light Nearly half a century has passed since the Apollo 17 mission but NASA is now working to get astronauts back to the moon x27  surface NASA
