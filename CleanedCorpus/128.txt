Steve Jobs  bsp Steve Jobs  39 vision of a  uot omputer for the rest of us uot sparked the PC revolution and made Apple an icon of American business But somewhere along the way Jobs 39 vision got clouded   some say by his ego   and he was ousted from the company he helped found Few will disagree that Jobs did indeed impede Apple 39  growth yet without him the company lost its sense of direction and pioneering spirit After nearly 10 years of plummeting sales Apple turned to its visionary founder for help and a little older and wiser Jobs engineered one of the most amazing turnarounds of the 20th century The adopted son of a Mountain View Calif  machinist Steve Jobs showed an early interest in electronics and gadgetry While in high school he boldly called Hewlett ackard co ounder and president William Hewlett to ask for parts for a school project Impressed by Jobs Hewlett not only gave him the parts but also offered him a summer internship at Hewlett ackard It was there that Jobs met and befriended Steve Wozniak  a young engineer five years his senior with a penchant for tinkering After graduating from high school Jobs enrolled in Reed College in Portland Ore but dropped out after one semester He had become fascinated by Eastern spiritualism and took a part ime job designing video games for Atari in order to finance a trip to India to study Eastern culture and religion Related nbsp Steve Jobs An Extraordinary Career When Jobs returned to the U   he renewed his friendship with Wozniak who had been trying to build a small computer To Wozniak it was just a hobby but the visionary Jobs grasped the marketing potential of such a device and convinced Wozniak to go into business with him In 1975 the 20 ear ld Jobs and Wozniak set up shop in Jobs 39 parents 39 garage dubbed the venture Apple and began working on the prototype of the Apple I To generate the   50 in capital they used to start Apple Steve Jobs sold his Volkswagen microbus and Steve Wozniak sold his Hewlett ackard calculator Although the Apple I sold mainly to hobbyists it generated enough cash to enable Jobs and Wozniak to improve and refine their design In 1977 they introduced the Apple II   the first personal computer with color graphics and a keyboard Designed for beginners the user riendly Apple II was a tremendous success ushering in the era of the personal computer First ear sales topped   million Two years later sales ballooned to  00 million But by 1980 Apple 39  shine was starting to wear off Increased competition combined with less than stellar sales of the Apple III and its follow p the LISA caused the company to lose nearly half its market to IBM Faced with declining sales Jobs introduced the Apple Macintosh in 1984 The first personal computer to feature a graphical ser interface controlled by a mouse the Macintosh was a true breakthrough in terms of ease f se But the marketing behind it was flawed Jobs had envisioned the Mac as a home computer but at   95 it was too expensive for the consumer market When consumer sales failed to reach projections Jobs tried pitching the Mac as a business computer But with little memory no hard drive and no networking capabilities the Mac had almost none of the features corporate America wanted For Jobs this turn of events spelled serious trouble He clashed with Apple 39  board of directors and in 1983 was ousted from the board by CEO John Sculley whom Jobs had handpicked to help him run Apple Stripped of all power and control Jobs eventually sold his shares of Apple stock and resigned in 1985 Related nbsp As Steve Jobs Once Said  39 eople With Passion Can Change The World 39 Later that year using a portion of the money from the stock sale Jobs launched NeXT Computer Co  with the goal of building a breakthrough computer that would revolutionize research and higher education Introduced in 1988 the NeXT computer boasted a host of innovations including notably fast processing speeds exceptional graphics and an optical disk drive But priced at   50 the NeXT was too expensive to attract enough sales to keep the company afloat Undeterred Jobs switched the company 39  focus from hardware to software He also began paying more attention to his other business Pixar Animation Studios which he had purchased from George Lucas in 1986 After cutting a three icture deal with Disney Jobs set out to create the first ever computer nimated feature film Four years in the making  uot oy Story uot was a certified smash hit when it was released in November 1995 Fueled by this success Jobs took Pixar public in 1996 and by the end of the first day of trading his 80 percent share of the company was worth   billion After nearly 10 years of struggling Jobs had finally hit it big But the best was yet to come Within days of Pixar 39  arrival on the stock market Apple bought NeXT for  00 million and re ppointed Jobs to Apple 39  board of directors as an advisor to Apple chairman and CEO Gilbert F Amelio It was an act of desperation on Apple 39  part Because they had failed to develop a next eneration Macintosh operating system the firm 39  share of the PC market had dropped to just 5  percent and they hoped that Jobs could help turn the company around At the end of March 1997 Apple announced a quarterly loss of  08 million Three months later Amelio resigned and Jobs took over as interim CEO Once again in charge of Apple Jobs struck a deal with Microsoft to help ensure Apple 39  survival Under the arrangement Microsoft invested  50 million for a nonvoting minority stake in Apple and the companies agreed to  uot ooperate on several sales and technology fronts quot Next Jobs installed the G3 PowerPC microprocessor in all Apple computers making them faster than competing Pentium PCs He also spearheaded the development of the iMac a new line of affordable home desktops which debuted in August 1998 to rave reviews Under Jobs 39 guidance Apple quickly returned to profitability and by the end of 1998 boasted sales of    billion Against all odds Steve Jobs pulled the company he founded and loved back from the brink Apple once again was healthy and churning out the kind of breakthrough products that made the Apple name synonymous with innovation But Apple 39  innovations were just getting started Over the next decade the company rolled out a series of revolutionary products including the iPod portable digital audio player in 2001 an online marketplace called the Apple iTunes Store in 2003 the iPhone handset in 2007 and the iPad tablet computer in 2010 The design and functionality of these devices resonated with users worldwide Related nbsp 10 Must ead Inspiring Biographies of Business Leaders Despite his professional successes Jobs struggled with health issues In mid 004 he announced in an email to Apple employees that he had undergone an operation to remove a cancerous tumor from his pancreas In January 2011 following a liver transplant Jobs said he was taking a medical leave of absence from Apple but said he 39  continue as CEO and  uot e involved in major strategic decisions for the company quot Eight months later on August 24
