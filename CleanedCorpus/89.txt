August 5 2011 Share Email Using Gmail Yahoo Outlook Other Can't"day" just mean a period of time Darius and Karin Viet explain I wanted to comment on an article or part of a book that I read Specifically this If the days of creation are really geologic ages of millions of years then the gospel message is undermined at its foundation because it puts death disease thorns and suffering before the Fall The effort to define days as geologic ages results from an erroneous approach to Scripture reinterpreting the Word of God on the basis of the fallible theories of sinful people  This is wrong Really wrong This is possibly the worst thing I have ever read relating to the bible I do not know what bible this person read or how they read it but they did it wrong To start the Fall happened eons before the creation of earth Second who made this guy the end all be all of how to interpret the bible Third  his is very important  when the bible was originally written it didn't have the word day in it Any one who paid attention in seminary knows that the original Greek word meant"period of time  which could be one nano second or a billion years Those of us who choose to define"period of time" as a billion years would actually seem more correct because if the bible says Earth was made in six"periods of time  and science tells us that the earth was created in 6 billion years then one could conclude that because of the infinity of God a billion years to him would seem like a day to us I hope that the creators of this site realize that it was God who created science and to completely disregard what God created is an affront to Him and everything He has ever done for us –A Dear A  Thank you for contacting AiG We'd like to address your concerns in this reply First why is there no general email for comments on the website or articles You may make comments at the" Inquiries and Comments" section of the website As such I wanted to comment on an article or part of a book that I read Specifically this"If the days of creation are really geologic ages of millions of years then the gospel message is undermined at its foundation because it puts death disease thorns and suffering before the Fall The effort to define days as geologic ages results from an erroneous approach to Scripture reinterpreting the Word of God on the basis of the fallible theories of sinful people  The article you are referencing is" Could God Really Have Created Everything in Six Days   a chapter in The New Answers Book 1  In this chapter Ken Ham shows how reading the creation account in a straightforward way applying the proper hermeneutic for interpreting historical narrative and considering the other passages of Scripture on this subject will lead one to conclude that the word for"day" in the creation account is a 24 our day This is wrong Really wrong This is possibly the worst thing I have ever read relating to the bible I do not know what bible this person read or how they read it but they did it wrong To start the Fall happened eons before the creation of earth How do you know that"the Fall happened eons before the creation of the earth" Our beliefs are based on one of two starting points  We either start with the infallible Word of God or the fallible opinions of man According to the infallible Word of God the Fall occurred on earth when Adam and Eve ate from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil So the Fall obviously happened after the creation of the earth Second who made this guy the end all be all of how to interpret the bible Ken Ham is certainly not the end all be all of how to interpret the Bible The Bible itself sets the standard for its interpretation We invite you to consider Part 1 and Part 2 of this article on Bible interpretation principles Part 2 specifically shows how Genesis 1–11 should be interpreted as historical narrative according to the following principles carefully observe the text context is key clarity of Scripture compare Scripture with Scripture classification of the text and the church's historical view Third  his is very important  when the bible was originally written it didn't have the word day in it Any one who paid attention in seminary knows that the original Greek word meant"period of time  which could be one nano second or a billion years Respectfully the original word is a Hebrew not Greek word since the Old Testament was written primarily in Hebrew  ith a few sections in Aramaic  The New Testament was written in Greek While the Hebrew word for"day" can refer to an indeterminate period of time or the daylight portion of the day the context gives us the proper interpretation Dr Terry Mortenson said"Everywhere else in the Old Testament when the Hebrew word for'day'  יוֹם  yom  appears with'evening' or'morning' or is modified by a number    'sixth day' or'five days'  it always means a 24 our day  1 You are correct that many Christian seminaries don't hold to a literal interpretation of Genesis That's because they have compromised with worldly ideas instead of standing firm on God's Word as shown by the book Already Compromised  Those of us who choose to define"period of time" as a billion years would actually seem more correct because if the bible says Earth was made in six"periods of time  and science tells us that the earth was created in 6 billion years then one could conclude that because of the infinity of God a billion years to him would seem like a day to us First claiming that"science tells us" is a logical fallacy of reification  We interpret the evidence of past events according to our worldviews Second you may be referencing 2 Peter 3   which says" with the Lord one day is as a thousand years and a thousand years as one day" Ken Ham addressed this verse  showing how it has nothing to do with the creation account and uses the word"as" because it is making a comparison not a literal statement that a day equals a thousand years This verse does not refer to the creation account but instead shows how God is not limited by time so even though Christ's return is delayed the interval of time since His ascension is nothing to God I hope that the creators of this site realize that it was God who created science and to completely disregard what God created is an affront to Him and everything He has ever done for us You are right that God is the Author of scientific laws However He is also the Author of the Bible His special revelation in which He tells us He created the earth—in six days  Genesis 1  Exodus 20 1   Jesus Himself affirmed a young earth  We should trust God's complete and inerrant Word instead of the fallible opinions of man This doesn't mean Christians are anti cience  Rather when interpreting scientific evidence a Christian's starting point should be the Word of the One who created everything The biblical six ay position is essential to upholding the integrity of Scripture and leads to a clear understanding of the gospel  the sin of Adam and Eve brought death but God sent His Son to sacrifice His life for sinners who turn in faith to the Lord Jesus Lord bless you as you
