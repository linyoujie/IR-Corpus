Isaac Newton A n Indian minister has claimed that Indian scholars discovered gravity centuries before Issac Newton's famous encounter with an apple and called on the country's scientists to promote more homegrown theories The Minister for Human Resource Development Ramesh Pokhriyal on Saturday said that Indian scriptures mentioned the concept of gravity around the 5th century Mr Pokhriyal a member of the rightwing Hindu Bharatiya Janata Party gave a speech at an event ostensibly to discuss education policy but was organised by religious groups   The minister appealed to the directors of the Indian Institutes of Technology and National Institutes of Technology to undertake more research on ancient Indian science"We need to prove that all that we keep talking about like Charaka Aryabhata they all existed and that our scriptures mentioned the concept of gravity much before Newton discovered it  the news site The Print reported  Charaka was a scholar who developed the concept of Ayurvedic medicine and learning around 300 BC while Aryabhata was a 5th century mathematician and astronomer Sir Isaac Newton contemplates the force of gravity Credit Photo by Hulton Archive etty

Indians inventing everything from the internet to space travel T he event was attended by the chief of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh  SS  the hardline Hindu group often cited as the ideological parent of the BJP and prime minister Natendra Modi Several representatives from universities and schools attended also leading to many questioning the overlap between religion and science and the subsequent danger of"pseudo science" being taught However Mr Pokhriyal claimed children  questioned him when he said that India was ahead in all fields including science and technology "When we spoke about yoga people used to cringe  he added"Whatever we had in the past was never conveyed to the youngsters in a modern way we erred someway in communicating our ancient wisdom "This is why I want to appeal to all the directors of IITs and NITs that they should take up more research on ancient knowledge  The minister also asked the institutions to prove that Sanskrit is the"most scientific language" and the"most appropriate language" for talking computers – if they become a reality in the future the Indo sian News Service reported Related Topics Gravity India Bangladesh Isaac Newton
