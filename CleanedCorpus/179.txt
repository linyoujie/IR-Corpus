hold a Masters in Public History and specialize in telling the hidden stories of women and objects from ancient times to today Contact Author Answering the question  ho discovered America first  will be a continuous struggle History is never certain While we can know dates and names and events we can never be certain when a  irst happened This is because archaeology is continually revealing new evidence on our origins and historical events For a very long time everyone assumed that Columbus had first discovered America Yet in recent years the very term  iscovery has come under fire There were people in America before Columbus More importantly there are ancient texts that refer to various explorers who reached America from Europe  nd possibly China before Columbus So who really discovered America To answer this question we need to go back in time  Christopher Columbus  r someone else  Source In 1492  Columbus sailed the ocean blue In the year 1492 AD Columbus  iscovered America Well not really He actually bumped into a giant land mass that had been visited by Europeans  nd possibly others before It also happened to be inhabited at the time by anywhere from 2 million to 112 million people The population estimates are still under debate by scholars such as Henry Dobyns and Douglas Ubelaker However what is certain is that Columbus  and all the fabled tellings of his  iscovery  was not the first time to set foot on the soil of the Americas Were Africans first There is some evidence of African contact in pre olumbian civilizations In Mexico stone head portraits of basalt on the eastern coast bear a striking resemblance to African peoples Arab sources from the eighth century also detail contact between Africans and the Americas Additionally Portuguese sources speak of migrations from West Africa between 1311 and 1460 CE These sources tell us that Africans  nd most likely Arabs as well who inhabited the northwestern portions of Africa as well had sailed to Haiti Panama and possibly Brazil Columbus after his first contact encountered the Arawaks who told him of obtaining guanine spear points from black traders that came from the south and east Captain Balboa provided further evidence in his account of natives who had black slaves Sailing to Vinland Ah the Vikings Fabled seamen and storytellers In the Nordic sagas the Vikings have recounted the tale of Erik the Red and Leif Eriksson  on of Erik the Red who sailed to a land called  inland  Little credit had been given to the reality of this story until archaeological discoveries started yielding surprising information In 1362 the Kensington Stone was inscribed referring to an expedition of Norweigens and Goths who reached southwestern Minnesota in 1362 The stone was discovered in 1898 by a Swedish merica farmer near Kensington Minnesota Scholars initially labeled this stone as a fraud but research done by H R Holad in 1907 showed that the inscription could be from the 1300s based upon its word forms and numerals This evidence was further corroborated when an account dating to 1355 by a king of Sweden orway referred to a western settlement  Vest Bygd  in Greenland that helped colonists in Vinland The Kensington Stone  Source Other accounts  notably of Gudrid found in The Far Traveler  also mention Vinland Gudrid as a side note is thought to be the first European woman to have a baby in America The sagas refer to Leif Eriksson making landfall in Vinland as early as 1000 CE and his father Erik the Red making landfall about 984 CE They refer to Native Americans as  kraelings in the sagas Most of these come from Nordic folklore but many other aspects of their folklore have been proven true in recent decades Is it plausible that the Vikings could have reached America Yes their ships were fully capable of such a voyage But is there hard evidence Actually yes A Viking ra settlement bearing striking resemblances to Viking settlements in Scandinavian countries was found at L nse aux Meadows in Newfoundland Canada in 1960 Since then digs at the site have revealed over 300 years of sporadic contact between the Vikings and Native American peoples concentrated primarily in the Canadian Arctic A good series of articles with artifacts can be found at this Smithsonian website further detailing what may have occurred at the settlements Irish Monks and Giant Sea Turtles The Vikings unfortunately were not first St Brendan an Irish monk claimed in his writings to have found  nchanted islands far out in the Atlantic around 400 CE Most legends claim that St Brendan traveled across the Atlantic on the back of a sea turtle but ancient descriptions claim that he traveled in a tiny currach   traditional Irish boat of wood and leather  One reason St Brendan rose to popularity was due to the account of his travels in the 9th century The Voyage of St Brendan  a Latin book full of fantastic tales about his journey No hard evidence of his visit has been found though it is plausible that ship technology of the time might have reached Nordic settlements on Iceland or Greenland This was tested in 1976 by historian Tim Severin who built a traditional currach named Brendan and attempted to sail to North America from Ireland Severin was successful Unfortunately it is highly unlikely that St Brendan  tale is true It is more plausible that the accounts of St Brendan reflect stories of visits to the Americas since these stories were written down centuries after they had occurred  nd likely had been passed down orally and thus may have been elaborated with each retelling  However St Brendan  story did have a direct effect on the search for America his tale was used by Christopher Columbus as a reference to support his assertion that lands were reachable across the Atlantic Cleopatra and the Chinese In 600 BCE there is the possibility that Phoenicians or Egyptians may have visited the Americas There is speculation that Egyptian technology could have travelled as far the Canary Islands  ff the coast of Spain or Ireland though it has been untested  o date as to whether their technology could have reached the Americas However Negroid and Caucasoid likenesses in sculpture and ceramics of the Americas as well as some accounts in Arab history suggest that contact may have occurred Additionally in 1000 BCE it is thought that the Chinese may have reached Central America The evidence is of fairly low quality However some Chinese legends and cultural similarities exist between Native Americans and the Chinese No hard evidence has been found to date  dditionally evidence has been found that the Chinese may have reached America in 1421 CE  70 years before Columbus  Map of potential migration routes into America  Source Walking on Thin Ice However if we are asking who truly  iscovered America  the first person to set foot on the soil of any of the American continents  then we must venture into prehistory In the Pleistocene era the Cordilleran and Laurentide ice sheets formed a narrow corridor and land bridge between Russia and what is now Alaska So far archaeological evidence suggests that the first people  who would become the  irst Americans  walked this land bridge and through the corridor into North America Traveling south these peoples would have encountered northern deciduous forests of oak hickory and beech lining what is now the Gulf Coast These migrations took place over long periods of time as the ice sheets opened and closed the corridor But who were these people Most likely they were groups from Asia In order to find out paleoanthropologists utilize many different methods language dental records and mitochondrial DNA testing There are some debates between these methods revealing that the  irst Americas most likely spoke languages of the Amerind family had dental records that matched those of Southwest Asians  he Sundadont family  but whose mitochondrial DNA had very different characteristics than those of modern Asians  uggesting that the  plit between modern Asians and Native Americans occurred at least 21 00 years ago  What we do know for certain however is that after the ice sheets melted and the Ice Age came to an end those who had migrated to the Americas  whether by foot or possibly by boat  became relatively isolated from developments in the rest of the world This isolation resulted in a loss of immunity to diseases which would come back to haunt the natives when Europe came calling Related History Before Columbus The Forgotten Expeditions to

Shakeel Christ bsp 11 months ago We know another Name Amerigo vespucci whose Discover America  Kindly tell me who first discovered America Amerigo or Columbus cooper bsp 17 months ago thank you very much AUTHOR Tiffany R Isselhardt bsp 17 months ago from USA Hi Cooper this information was from a variety of sources including textbooks lecture notes from undergraduate courses that I took and research into the topic I particularly recommend The Far Traveler by Nancy Brown works of Gavin Menzies The Brendan Voyage by Tim Severin and In the Hands of the Great Spirit by Jake Page   personally love Jake Page squo  work and recommend all of what he has written  he is great on American prehistory  Cooper bsp 17 months ago where sorry Cooper bsp 17 months ago were did you get this information from AUTHOR Tiffany R Isselhardt bsp 17 months ago from USA Hi Edwar So glad to hear this article helped Best wishes for your studies Edwar bsp 18 months ago I LOVE HISTORY Thanks for the help you gave me an A on my test mark bsp 2 years ago Columbus was certainly not the first to discover America Vikings were definitely there early 11th century also Polynesians were in Hawaii in 4th century so why is Columbus credited for discovering America Chinese might have there also they can prove if they were but they can prove they were not also Irish writings on a cave prove that these writing are over a thousand years old Bob Allen bsp 2 years ago Only Columbus matters in the discovery of America because only he reported it in a meaningful way wba108 ahoo om bsp 2 years ago from upstate NY Columbus should be given credit for being the first Discovery of America to be be followed up opening trade and colonization in the New World The Viking never permanently colonized the America  Of course the settlers who originally arrived in the America  probably arrived through the Bering straits land bridge but afterwords there was virtually no contact between the America  and the rest of the world I would consider Columbus voyages to be voyages of discovery because by that time the old Viking voyages were a distant memory to most and Columbus still believed he had reached Asia till his final voyage There was no knowledge that the early Vikings had discovered the same continent that Columbus had at that time Errorsans115 bsp 2 years ago hi this stuff looks really great  mossabezzat bsp 2 years ago Great article AUTHOR Tiffany R Isselhardt bsp 6 years ago from USA  erp  Thank you I  glad the information was so helpful I hope to teach university courses one day so knowing that how I  writing and presenting information is helping students now is great feedback Derp bsp 6 years ago Thank you Hub I wanted to thank you for the information that you gave to me excellent work on the way you put every bit of information for me and without I wouldn  have got an A on my Social Studies Report I will go here more often now that I have found a site that has given me the correct answers and details to make it easy for me to explain what I have researched If you guys are reading this now This site is   to go to at a last minute project Thank You Hub Derp bsp 6 years ago I believe that the Indians Possibly found America first I don  really know though   I have a Social Studies Assignment on this and I haven  even started AHHH Help me please everyone   dereon puryear bsp 7 years ago This was a very informational text and the vidoes and pictures helped me understand it even more AUTHOR Tiffany R Isselhardt bsp 7 years ago from USA  aitlin newsome   this is the beauty of history We never know the full answer So there is no  uot ne uot answer to who discovered America because it  all about who actually got to the continent first  nd hence we will never have a name ace for the Bering Strait travelers  This hub is meant more to show that Columbus wasn  the first and history knows it because there are all these wonderful clues in history that point to lots of  uot iscoveries uot of America over a long period of time caitlin newsome bsp 7 years ago I want to know who discovered america first anna141 bsp 7 years ago from India Such a interesting article    Kitty Fields bsp 7 years ago from Summerland Very intriguing Loved this article I e always been one to root for the Natives they were really the first after all And from what I e heard Columbus wasn  that nice of a dude anyway  aping and pillaging Those two words take away  uot xplorer uot to me Thanks and voted up wba108 ahoo om bsp 7 years ago from upstate NY My theory is that most discoveries occur because there is an economic or military advantages associated with it Columbus discovered America because he wanted a shortest route from which to trade with the far east Megellan had much the same profit motive as Columbus The Chinese really didn  need to try to find a short cut to Europe because they had the most sought after goods in their own country so they were content to stay put The Chinese had hands down the most advanced society in their region wheras the Europeans were forced to compete with many other similar nation states in order to survive This is why the Europeans were in a desperate race to get a leg up on new trade routes and their monarchs were willing to risk much to accomplish their goals Its really surprising the viking were able to reach America because their culture was fairly primative other than their weaponry I e never heard that Arab sources from the 8th century wrote about contact between Africa and the Americas Island Tropical bsp 7 years ago you know people it is me who ask this question but it is her that get all the glory   Paul Swendson bsp 7 years ago I imagine that as time passes and new information comes to light the textbooks of the future when addressing this topic will be very different from those today Instead of describing Columbus as the discoverer of America it is best to think of him as the man who introduced Europeans of the late 15th century to the  uot ew World quot And this introduction of the Old World to The New would ultimately transform the entire planet So whether he is referred to as a discoverer or not he is still one of the most important historical figures of the last 500 years Rebecca Mealey bsp 7 years ago from Northeastern Georgia USA This has some fascinating information The possibility of so much activity on what we thought was the last frontier Cleopatra in America She might have discovered Hollywood LOL Theresa Ast bsp 7 years ago from Atlanta Georgia Hi Southern

Birmingham England A very interesting and informative hub The part about St Brendan and his sighting of enchanted islands was particularly fascinating I wonder what those first Native Americans
