get the haunting suspicion that this is a trap Your instincts are right it's a trap The answer may surprise you How long is a day on Earth Or more specifically how long does it take for the Earth to turn once on its axis For all the stars to move through the sky and return to their original position Go ahead and yell your answer answer at the screen… 24 hours Wrong It only takes 23 hours 56 minutes and 4 916 seconds for the Earth to turn once its axis Unless that's what you said In which case congratulations I'm sure you're now stumbling around in an incoherent state trying to understand how you could have possibly messed this up Were you reprogrammed by the hidden chronology conspiracy Have time travellers been setting back all your clocks every day by 4 minutes How was your whole life a lie Here's the deal When you consider a day you're probably thinking of your trusty clock or maybe that smartphone lock screen that clearly measures 24 hours What you have come to understand as a"day" is classified by astronomers as a solar day It's the amount of time it takes for the Sun to move through the sky and return to roughly the same spot This is different from the amount of time it takes for the Earth to turn once on its axis – the 23 hours 56 minutes Also known as a sidereal day Why are these two numbers different Imagine the Earth orbiting the Sun taking a full 365 days 5 hours 48 minutes and 46 seconds to complete the entire journey At the same time the Earth is spinning on its axis Each day that goes by the Earth needs to turn a little further for the Sun to return to the same place in the sky  And that extra time is about 4 minutes If we only measured sidereal days the position of the Sun would slip back day after day For half of the year the Sun would be up between 12am and 12pm and for the other half it would be between 12pm and 12am There would be no connection between what time it is and whether or not the Sun is in the sky Axis of the Earth's pole Credit NASA  Mysid Can you imagine teaching your children how to read a clock and then getting them to multiply that by the calendar to figure out when My Little Pony Friendship is Magic starts Madness Better to keep them in the dark teach them that a day is 24 hours and deny all knowledge when they get a little older and start to ask you challenging questions But pedants among you already knew that didn't you You already knew that a sidereal day is a little shorter than a solar day and that everyone else has been living a lie You're the only one who can read the signs and know the terrifying truth Aren't you Well I'm here to tell you that you're wrong too There's a deeper conspiracy that you're not a part of Dear Pedant your life is also a lie The axis of the Earth's pole the imaginary line that you could draw between the south pole and the north pole is currently pointed roughly at Polaris aka The North Star But we're wobbling like a top and where the axis is pointing is slowly precessing westward over the course of 26 00 years This means that a sidereal day is actually 0 084 seconds shorter when you account for this extra movement of the Earth's axis Earthquakes Credit USGS  Google Maps  AJAX  SODA There are other events that can increase or decrease the length of an Earth day Because of our tidal interactions with the Moon the length of a day on Earth has increased by about 1  milliseconds over the last 100 years Powerful earthquakes can change the Earth's rotation time by a few microseconds depending on how the tectonic plates shove around Even as the glaciers melt the rotation speed slows down a little more So if someone asks you how long a day is make sure they clarify whether it's a solar day or a sidereal day And then ask if they'd like you to incorporate the Earth's precession tidal locking and recent earthquakes into the calculation If they give you a knowing nod congratulations you're talking to another member of the vast chronology

the information Fraser and have a Great Day  230  r is it Random Sample says November 5 2015 at 8 4 PM I 8217 e know the difference between a solar day and a sidereal day since I was a teenager and I 8217  in my 50 8217  so the whole bit about the reader stumbling about incoherently etc  was more than a bit overblown It doesn 8217  make much difference to me in everyday life although it does come into play when trying to explain to non stronomy types why the stars don 8217  rise at the same time every day It often occurs to me however when it comes to reading how long the days are on other planets  sually the days described for other planets are sidereal and for some planets with very slow rotation like Mercury and Venus it makes a big difference  Smokey says November 6 2015 at 2 0 AM Hello R    8220  230 So the whole bit about the reader stumbling about incoherently etc  was more than a bit overblown  8221 I feel as though many times Fraser is just channeling his Dad ess in these videos like he was trying to explain these topics to his elementary iddle school ged child who had just asked about it out of the blue If you look at it that way his style is not as annoying as it might first seem This coming from the father of nearly dult kids who are NOT currently planning to join the community of space elated technicians Whether despite or because of Smokey the Dad 8217  influence remains a deep mystery 8230 Also you make a great point about the difference between the solar  mp sidereal days of slowly otating planets A lot of times people will see  e   the sidereal day for Mercury  ot quite 59 Terran solar days and think that if they somehow crash anded there in the middle of the local night they 8217  have about four weeks to find some seriously air onditioned shelter However due to Nabu 8217  odd orbital characteristics the solar day there actually lasts almost half an Earth year you might have as much as four Terran months to figure out a plan to either follow the shade of night or construct your own Crazier still is the fact that at some points the orbital velocity  mp the spin rate of Mercury cause double sunrises  mp sunsets on the same day in some places while in others the sun crosses directly overhead three separate times before slowly setting That 8217  nothing to do with the actual length of the day but still  s Fraser would say   8220 adness  221  You didn 8217  think George Lucas came up with that name all by himself did you Of course Gene Roddenberry did it first w  221 ulcan  221 so I 8217  certainly not judging    Random Sample says November 6 2015 at 2 3 AM Excellent points down the line chfosmith says November 6 2015 at 4 0 AM Hi Fraser The statement  8221 Even as the glaciers melt the rotation speed slows down a little more  221 is incorrect As the glaciers melt the rotation speeds up Think of the classical example of the ice skater As he he draws in his er arms the rotational rate increases The slowing comes from the massive hydroelectric projects  amming rivers    3 Gorges Upper Nile etc  of China Turkey Ethiopia and other countries plus other factors such as the tidal drag of the moon My opinion is that these hydroelectric projects are a better option than adding a coal fired generator every day which was occurring because of the large increase in demand for electricity Plus it offsets the rise in sea level from melting glaciers Smokey says November 6 2015 at 5 0 AM Your ice skating example is a good way to look at it but it actually tends to back what Fraser said The idea is that melting glaciers tend to remove solid inflexible mass of ice from the land nearer to the poles     more in line w he skater 8217  axis of rotation  which is then added to the very fluid  ha mass of the water in the oceans Luna then pulls much of this newly mobile mass to the tidal bulges closer to the equator     away from the axis of rotation  slowing things down In addition larger tidal bulges  rom more water mass result in more Earth lowing friction So it 8217  sort of like having our spinning ice dancer hold a single pose while every silver sequin suddenly turns into an equal mass of quicksilver once in liquid form it all runs to her is  8220 quator  221 slowing the rate of spin Again that 8217  the hypothesis and in a perfect computer odel world it most definitely DOES slow the Earth 8217  rotation Bigger tidal bulges  slower rotation Just ask me    Whether it actually works this way in the analog universe has proven extraordinarily hard to calculate easure There 8217  the question of the degree of the rebounding lithosphere the compensatory large cale shifting of tectonic masses in response to changes in crustal structure and so on and the whole thing is actually the subject of some fairly spirited scientific debate  f every single UT article that mentions the Earth 8217  rotation responding to melting glaciers  FarAwayLongAgo says November 6 2015 at 6 0 AM And actually Antarctic glaciers are growing NASA research shows https  ww asa ov eature oddard asa tudy ass ains f ntarctic ce heet reater han osses So it 8217  the other way around again chfosmith says November 6 2015 at 3 9 PM I think one of many examples is necessary here The Three Gorges dam in China took 9 years to complete and fill with 40 cubic kilometers of water All of the glaciers in Switzerland have in total about 60 cubic kilometers of ice During the same nine years the Swiss glaciers lost 9 cubic kilometers of ice The water from all of the Swiss glaciers that went into the oceans evaporated rained and was trapped behind the 3 Gorges dam was not enough There were another 31 cubic kilometers necessary that had to come from other glaciers and oceans This shows how difficult this problem is The water that came from the Swiss glaciers sped up the earths rotation but the water that evaporated from the South China Sea and was trapped behind the Three Gorges dam slowed down the earths rotation Yes Sweden and the rest of Scandinavia are rising because the pressure of the ice from the last ice age has been removed and this would cause a slight rise in sea level  ome parts of the ocean become deeper because of the geological shift  but the next project of the Chinese on the Yangtze River is almost twice the size of the 3 Gorges for two reasons First the 3 Gorges dam does not help reduce flooding on the Yangtze river to the extent hoped Second the 3 Gorges dam provides only about 1  of the electricity demand of China and the Chinese need to get hydro power to about 30 of the electrical generating capacity of China Another example if you are a Vietnam war era veteran look at a current picture of the Mekong river The water levels are way down because of a different Chinese dam project When taking all of these hydroelectric projects world wide together I come to the conclusion that the rise of the land mass of Scandinavia and the melting of glaciers while significant can not be used without considering the hydroelectric projects to determine the rate of the earths rotation and most computer models do not properly factor in the amount of hydro power generated electricity needed in the future and its effects Smokey says November 7 2015 at 2 3 AM Hello chfosmith I 8217 e mentioned in my comments on previous articles that the whole thing is like trying to figure out how much the top speed of a whale is affected by the amount ype of bacteria growing on its skin the answer regardless of net direction is  8220 OT MUCH  221   That being said  8220 he Three Gorges dam in China took 9 years to complete and fill with 40 cubic kilometers of water All of the glaciers in Switzerland have in total about 60 cubic kilometers of ice During the same nine years the Swiss glaciers lost 9 cubic kilometers of ice The water from all of the Swiss glaciers that went into the oceans evaporated rained and was trapped behind the 3 Gorges dam was not enough There were another 31 cubic kilometers necessary that had to come from other glaciers and oceans  221 Aside from your math which compares various volumes of material with unlike densities  ater  mp ice do not weigh the same per unit volume  230 is Switzerland the only place on Earth with glaciers I think Alaska and Greenland and Antarctica  mong MANY others are all going to be very surprised What exactly was NASA measuring in the paper F    shared with us earlier in the comments Also I would be very surprised if it was not China 8217  own glaciers which did most of the filling of the 3 Gorges Dam reservoir as opposed to Switzerland 8217  the mighty Yangtze 8217  headwaters  mp tributaries reach all the way to the mountains of Tibet 8230 and yes there are glaciers there as well  8220 he water that came from the Swiss glaciers sped up the earths rotation but the water that evaporated from the South China Sea and was trapped behind the Three Gorges dam slowed down the earths rotation  221 I mean no disrespect however this is exactly backwards per the figure kating example we each keep citing With the Swiss ice loss we are figuratively  8220 preading the arms 8221 of the ice skater by pulling mass away from the axis of rotation and allowing it to move outward to the Equator taking water from the South China Sea  mp trapping it behind the dam does exactly the opposite pulling mass away from the Equator and towards the axis of rotation  8220 rawing the arms in 8221 and increasing the spin rate Aside from your  8220 O HYDRO POWER  221 stance  ith which I don 8217  necessarily disagree  your fixation on Switzerland and Scandinavia  8212 though both are in Europe they are actually two separate  mp distinct regions  8212 is curious to me Not all glaciers in the Alps run through Switzerland and the glaciers elsewhere in the world dwarf those of all the Alps together is there something about Swiss ice which naturally contributes to the 3 Gorges Dam while the rest of the world 8217  glacial melt  8212 the vast majority  8212 does not If you were simply using the amount of volume in Switzerland 8217  glaciers to demonstrate the massive scale of the Dam that 8217  certainly fair but it would take dozens  ot to say scores or hundreds of reservoirs on the scale of the 3 Gorges Dam to trap all of the glacial melt water in the world And just as more dams are planned for China in other places the lack of flooding and free water flow is causing issues for both human agriculture and the environment This has led to a number of dams having to significantly scale back power production while the flows are being increased or decreased to match seasonal needs downstream and in some cases it has led to them being removed altogether You are correct in this though the whole problem is particularly complex Whatever the net effect of glacial melt or hydroelectric projects the issue is not very easy to model and in the end is mainly a lot to do about nothing terribly significant You  mp I are certainly not going to profit or suffer very much from the gain or loss of a microsecond 8217  worth of sleep   Comments are closed Post navigation Previous

watching the red giant Betelgeuse noted how much the star had dimmed continuing to steadily fade for months It's a variable star and it's known to get dimmer and brighter but the big surprise is that it's still continuing to dim recently passing magnitude 1 6 and still getting dimmer This is unprecedented in the decades that astronomers have been watching the star The world's biggest telescopes are on the case and the European Southern Observatory released dramatic new images of Betelguese resolving features on the star's surface and surrounding area showing how it's dramatically changed
