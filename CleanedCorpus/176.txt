Americas far later than other continents However emerging new evidence suggests seafarers reached the continents thousands of years earlier and developed far more sophisticated civilizations than previously imagined    From  34 istinguished historian 34  BC World Service Gavin Menzies the author of the blockbuster New York Times bestseller 1421  comes a revolutionary new account of how the first humans came to North and South America Menzies reveals that ancient peoples used the oceans 39 natural currents and prevailing winds to make voyages across both the Atlantic and Pacific What 39  more we now must accept that they had time to develop remarkably advanced cultures Armed with cutting dge DNA evidence newly unearthed artifacts and astonishing linguistic and archaeological discoveries Menzies shows humans have been making transoceanic voyages as far back as 100 00 years ago vastly predating the supposed overland migration to the Americas during the last Ice Age the ancient South American civilizations of the Olmec and Maya in Central and South America may have had direct origins and influences from Asia ancient maps held in the Library of Congress in Washington D   show there must have been sustained and dedicated voyages to the Western Hemisphere by Chinese explorers as early as 2200 B   huge Chinese settlements occupied  nd made exploratory journeys from Nova Scotia Japanese Korean and even earlier European voyages likewise predated the explorations currently recorded by history A maverick scholar Menzies has made a riveting new contribution to the

I selected this book softer reading the books  491 and  493 which reviewed what the world was like before and after Columbus sailed This book reviews the evidence that he was the first to discover America Evidence from genetics and cartography and many other scientific fields Some of most fascinating information came from many archeological digs all over the americas that I was completely unaware of their existence I chose four stars because sometimes it drags but it is still greatly interesting and fascinating Read more 20 people found this helpful Helpful Sending feedback  Thank you

Format Paperback Verified Purchase Although I come from an engineering background and hence am a little skeptical of other than mainstream concepts I will admit that I have always harbored a belief that much of what we consider  34 istory 34 is highly pasteurized With all due respect to serious historians theories as complex as how why and why people came to the Americas need input from all available sources to be comprehensible not just the facts that support for instance Beringia or Clovis points of view Mr Menzies has done a great job collecting scientific research  lthough he isn  reluctant to include some anecdotal information as well as his own significant contribution in making sense of all the disparate information that doesn  fit the prevailing theories This is an extremely interesting book for the amateur history buff like myself even if you don  necessarily agree with all of his conclusions Read more 20 people found this helpful Helpful Sending feedback

Format Kindle Edition Verified Purchase First of all Gavin Menzies knows what he  talking about However I was a little disappointed in that it dealt primarily with the ancient findings in Chile Which is very important but I was hoping he would cover more territory Most writers of pre istory ignore that the earliest archeological findings in America will never be found because they are covered by up to 300 feet of water off the present west coast of America You must remember that the ocean levels were much lower 12k to 30k years ago and as such peoples coasting from Asia across Beringia to America left their traces on land that is now under water The Clovis people were NOT the first peoples in the New World as Menzies shows in this book but the whole story may never be known unless serious underwater archeology is attempted Read more 29 people found this helpful Helpful Sending feedback  Thank you for your feedback Sorry we failed to record your vote Please try again Comment

before I quit Life is too short to spend my time reading a bad book When Gavin Menzies isn't twisting facts to fit his theory he becomes a bad version of Paul Theroux writing about his travel

global warming is a hoax Trump's inauguration crowd was bigger than Obama's etc  you might find"Who Discovered America  a credible book There have been cases of Japanese fishermen in the early 1800's

Edition Verified Purchase This book was a fun read but I don  think I  recommend using it as a valid source for serious research Archeologists are a rather tunnel isioned group as a whole but the  34 vidence 34 presented here seemed rather far etched with little tangible proof and lots of assumptions that the Chinese settled both North and South America to the extent claimed Still it  always interesting to read various points of view On the whole I enjoyed the book but with a good dose of skepticism Read more 8 people found this helpful Helpful Sending feedback  Thank you for your

Purchase He doesn  do any real research just visits archaeological sites for an hour or two and comes away thinking that makes him an expert His reasoning is also clearly off Stone Age peoples couldn  have migrated by land bridge across the Bering Straits because he ran out of gas and couldn  drive across He also discounts their ability to survive the environment because he doesn  know how he would find food and keep warm Get over yourself I stopped reading because I was afraid the junk would pollute my mind and pop up later without my remembering the source Read more 3 people found this helpful

first explorers that came to America before Columbus Forget Columbus he did not discover America he was given the honor as well as Amerigo Vespucci whom America is named after Many cultures came here

as we have been taught so far 100  Reviewed in the United Kingdom on September 7 2016 Format Kindle Edition Verified Purchase Brilliant and factual  a must for those who were taught of Columbus Vasco Da Gama  Eric the Red and more   have one slight reservation  omment and that is  r Menzies as with his other excellent books has uncovered so much new stuff and made so many links between discoveries from widely separated parts of the globe that sometimes his enthusiasm gets in the way of the readability But that is a comment  and the book is terrific Nice to see an untrained but meticulous and dogged researcher  xplorer finding such links Of course by his discoveries he has often upset the conventional wisdom of the alleged professionals all those letters after their names  and University dollars behind them They of course don  want to own up to missing things let alone to being plain wrong  Hence Menzies anxiety to get his information over I could imagine he  a nightmare to work with

Gavin Menzies previous books and this one did not disappoint either In this book Gavin sums up conclusions and hypotheses he  come to about areas of the Americas that he feels have been influenced by or even settled by early Asian explorers There is a melancholy in this work because he indicates this may be his last book I don  know if all of his assumptions are true and he himself is very clear about the fact that he would welcome more research But Menzies is no Von Daniken he is inviting us to think beyond the Eurocentric acount of world history that many of us have grown up with and I applaud him for it I can also see how irritating this can be to academic historians who have to be so careful not to trash their own reputations and risk their funding by saying anything controversial but that is not Gavin Menzies problem it is a problem that pervades the world of academia Mr Menzies invites us to think outside of the box of established world history and I hope others will follow in his footsteps Read more 9 people found this helpful Helpful Sending feedback  Thank you for your feedback Sorry we failed to record your vote Please try again Report abuse William Phillips 5  out
