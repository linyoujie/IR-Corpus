the U  Share Pin Email By Tonya Moreno CPA Reviewed By Janet Berry ohnson Updated January 22 2020 The Balance Almost every state in the country has a sales tax —45 of them plus the District of Columbia to be exact As of 2020 rates range from a high of 7 5 in California to just 2  in Colorado ﻿ ﻿ ﻿ ﻿ Most states also allow local counties cities and municipalities to add their own separate sales taxes to the state rate but there are a few consumer riendly exceptions  States Without a Sales Tax  Only five states do not have a sales tax  Alaska Delaware Montana New Hampshire and Oregon But this list is a little misleading because Alaska does allow localities to impose sales taxes and they average 1 6 not huge but it 39  not zero either ﻿ ﻿ Montana also allows local sales taxes ﻿ ﻿ Delaware doesn 39  have a sales tax but it does impose a gross receipts tax on businesses It 39  a percentage of total receipts from goods sold and services rendered within the state This tax ranges from 0 945 to 0 468 as of 2020 ﻿ ﻿ Although it 39  not technically charged to consumers its effect can nonetheless be felt in the sales prices of goods and services States With Low Sales Taxes Among states that  do  have a sales tax some are less significant than others Thirteen states impose taxes of 5 of the purchase price or less including five states where the tax is just 4  As of January 1 2020 they include Alabama     Colorado     Georgia    Hawaii    Louisiana   5  Missouri   3  New York    North Carolina   5  North Dakota    Oklahoma     South Dakota     Wisconsin    Wyoming    New Mexico just inches over the 5 line at 5 3  ﻿ ﻿ ﻿ ﻿ Combined State and Local Taxes Thirty ight states collect sales tax at both the state and local levels as of 2018 Only Connecticut Delaware Indiana Kentucky Maine Maryland Massachusetts Michigan Montana New Hampshire Oregon Rhode Island and the District of Columbia do not permit local sales taxes This makes Montana New Hampshire and Oregon the only states that truly do not impose any sales taxes at all or extra taxes that can trickle down to the consumer The local sales tax in some states is pretty negligible however Idaho 39  average is just 0 3 as of 2020 and Mississippi 39  average is 0 7  And when all of New Jersey 39  local taxes are averaged out it actually works out to a negative number   3  Among states that do allow for a combined sales tax Louisiana Tennessee Alabama Arkansas and Washington have the highest rates when state and local taxes are added together These combined rates range from 9 4 in Alabama up to 9 7 in Louisiana as of 2020 On the other end of the spectrum Hawaii Wisconsin and Wyoming have the lowest combined rates 4 1 in Hawaii 5 6 in Wyoming and 5 4 in Wisconsin ﻿ ﻿ ﻿ ﻿ Exemptions From State Sales Taxes Many of the states that have sales taxes exempt food but Alabama Hawaii Idaho Kansas Mississippi Oklahoma and South Dakota do include food items from their state sales taxes As of January 2020 some states charge a lesser sales tax on food items including Arkansas  125   Illinois    Missouri   25  Tennessee    Utah    Virginia     Food is subject to local sales taxes even if it 39  exempt from state sales taxes in a few states including Georgia Louisiana North Carolina and Tennessee  All states except Illinois exempt prescription drugs from state and local sales taxes Prescription drugs are subject to a 1 sales tax in Illinois  A handful of states also exempt non rescription drugs from sales taxes including  District of Columbia Florida Maryland Minnesota New Jersey New York Pennsylvania Texas Vermont Virginia ﻿ ﻿ Clothing is exempt from state sales taxes in a few states mainly in the Northeast These include Massachusetts Minnesota New Jersey New York Pennsylvania and Rhode Island ﻿ ﻿ Working It Out Both businesses and savvy consumers adjust when combined tax rates become prohibitive It 39  not uncommon for some New Jersey residents to cross over the border to shop in Delaware—it 39  often cheaper even with that gross receipts tax at play In fact New Jersey has taken steps to address this exempting Salem County—which abuts the state line—from collecting New Jersey 39  6 25 sales tax The state doesn 39  waive the tax for these residents entirely however It reduces it by half in an attempt to lure more consumers into doing their shopping at home ﻿ ﻿  Likewise many Chicagoans go outside the city for their purchases They pay a combined sales tax of a whopping 16  when they buy within city limits—10 5 at the local level plus 6 5 at the state level ﻿
