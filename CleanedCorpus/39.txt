the technology industry entertainment advertising  and pop culture was significant and he left behind an empire that changed how people interact with technology The Beginning of Apple Apple started with three men—Steve Jobs Steve Wozniak and Mike Markkula—who together in the late 1970s designed and marketed the Apple II series of computers It was the first commercially successful line of personal computers and led to the Apple Lisa in 1983—the first computer to use a mouse riven GUI  raphical user interface  One year later the Apple Macintosh was born and with it the Apple legend began to grow Jobs 39 Various Roles at Apple In 1985 after a long and drawn ut fight with the Apple board Jobs departed the company that he helped create Some say he was pushed or ousted others say he left simply to pursue other projects Whatever the case his next move was NeXT a tech company he founded that specialized in higher education and business In 1986 Jobs took a major interest in a small division of Lucasfilm Ltd Focused on the development of computer enerated graphics for animated movies Jobs acquired the company now known as Pixar After many small projects and lots of trial and error Pixar released  34 oy Story 34 in 1995 crediting Jobs as the executive producer Pixar became one of the most successful and prolific animated movie companies in the world One year after the release of  34 oy Story  4 in 1996 Apple bought the NeXT company that Jobs owned and asked him to come back in a leadership role He was interim CEO from 1997 to 2000 becoming the permanent CEO from that point until his eventual resignation in August of 2011 iPod and iPhone When Jobs returned in 1996 Apple was still a niche computer platform The vast majority of consumers owned less expensive Windows ased PCs with the higher riced Apple computers mainly being used in the creative industries including advertising design and motion pictures However that all changed when the iPod came along in November of 2001 The device which allowed thousands of songs to be stored digitally on one small device much smaller than any Walkman or CD player changed the way music was played and shared Within a few years Apple was the technology that everyone wanted to own And then came the iPhone in 2007 which took Apple from a major player to the company everyone was trying to emulate Overnight the iPhone reinvented cell phone technology and it was yet another victory for Steve Jobs His company Apple was the brand leader and the one leading the field In 2010 after many variations of the iPhone

million iPads were on the market Jobs Health and Death Jobs 39 health had been in question since around 2006 when his gaunt frail appearance and lackluster delivery were the focus of his WWDC keynote address In fact Jobs had announced to his staff in 2004 that he had pancreatic cancer Between 2003 and his death in August 2011 Jobs underwent many procedures and therapies to try and beat cancer but the disease was too aggressive He stepped down as CEO of Apple on August 24 2011 and died just a few weeks later Apple After Steve Jobs To say Apple greatly misses the influence of Steve Jobs would be
