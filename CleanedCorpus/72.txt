scientists to design and build computers researchers from many disciplines including physics mathematics and electrical engineering worked to develop the first computing machines Iowa State University 8217  role in the modern computing history began in 1937 when a physics professor and an electrical engineering alumnus  hen a graduate student in physics began working to develop the world 8217  first electronic digital computer World 8217  first electronic digital computer Clifford Berry with Atanasoff erry Computer  hoto courtesy Iowa State University Library pecial Collections Department  The Atanasoff erry Computer  BC was the world's first electronic digital computer John Vincent Atanasoff  a former Iowa State professor of physics and mathematics and Clifford Berry  a former physics graduate student and electrical engineering undergraduate built the computer at Iowa State University from 1937 to 1942 In the project 8217  proposal Atanasoff had planned to hire an electrical engineering student to assist him in building the computer He then met an electrical engineering professor Harold W Anderson while walking across campus Atanasoff told Anderson the type of student he wanted and Anderson replied  8220  have your man Clifford Berry  221 The ABC looked nothing like today 8217  computers It was the size of a big desk weighed 750 pounds and featured rotating drums for memory glowing vacuum tubes and a read rite system that recorded numbers by scorching marks on cards But the machine also was the first to use several innovations that are still a part of today 8217  computers a binary system of arithmetic separate memory and computing functions regenerative memory parallel processing electronic amplifiers as on ff switches circuits for logical addition and subtraction clocked control of electronic operations and a modular design The Controversy of the ABC The ABC 8217  place in computer history has been the subject of debate and even a federal court case When World War II interrupted work on the ABC Atanasoff and Berry moved on to other jobs and projects J Presper Eckert and John Mauchly developers of the ENIAC machine at the University of Pennsylvania were the first to patent an electronic digital computer In 1973 however U  District Judge Earl R Larson overturned the ENIAC patents writing  8220 ckert and Mauchly did not themselves first invent the automatic electronic digital computer but instead derived that subject matter from one Dr John Vincent Atanasoff  221   Read more about the case from an electrical engineering alumnus turned patent attorney who investigated the patent   President George Bush awarded Atanasoff the National Medal of Technology on November 13 1990 Atanasoff died in 1995 Berry died in 1963 before the patent controversy over the ABC began VIDEOS OF THE ATANASOFF ERRY COMPUTER Books on the first electronic digital computer Several individuals have written books on Atanasoff Berry and the electronic digital computer In particular R K Richards a 1943 Iowa State electrical engineering alumnus wrote Electronic Digital Systems Richards 8217 statement in the book that"the ancestry of all electronic digital systems appear to be traceable to … the Atanasoff erry Computer" was cited in the court case that determined who invented the first digital computer See a list of articles books and other resources  Atanasoff erry Computer Replica Atanasoff erry Computer replica  hoto by Bob Elbert As a tribute to the late inventors of the ABC a replica of the ABC was completed and demonstrated in 1997 It took a team of researchers engineers faculty members retired faculty and students from Iowa State and the U  Department of Energy 8217  Ames Laboratory four years and  50 00 to build the replica ABC The original was dismantled during the late 1940s and almost entirely discarded The current replica was moved to the Computer History Museum in Mountain View California in April 2010 The computer will be on display for 10 years with the possibility of an additional five years A display about the development and history of the ABC including replicas of several vacuum tubes and one of the machine 8217  rotating drums remains in the Durham Center at Iowa State Read an ISU alum 8217  personal account of rebuilding the ABC  More Information Books and articles The John Vincent Atanasoff
