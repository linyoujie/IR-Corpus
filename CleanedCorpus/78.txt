newsletter for leap second alerts Why Are the Days Getting Longer The speed of the Earth  rotation decreases over time but it also varies from day to day One of the main factors are the celestial bodies surrounding us For example the Moon  gravitational pull causes tides and changes the Earth  shape ultimately resulting in a lower rotational speed The distance between Earth and Moon changes constantly  which makes for daily variations in the speed our planet rotates around its own axis Find Day Length for any Date Month  bsp  bsp Day  bsp  bsp Year Date  bsp   Based on mean solar day
