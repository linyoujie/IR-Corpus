state  statute imposing a mandatory death sentence for an inmate who killed a fellow prisoner was unconstitutional The legislature repealed the law and removed it from the state criminal code in 1984 In 2004 the New York Court of Appeals held that a portion of the state  death penalty law was unconstitutional In 2007 the court ruled that its prior holding applied to the last remaining person on the state  death row The legislature has voted down attempts to restore the statute In March 2009 New Mexico voted to abolish the death penalty However the repeal was not retroactive leaving two people on the state  death row The New Mexico Supreme Court vacated those sentences on June 28 2019 and ordered the two prisoners be resentenced to life in prison In April 2012 the Connecticut legislature voted to abolish the death penalty for future crimes By its terms the repeal law did not affect the status of the 11 prisoners then on the state  death row The Connecticut Supreme Court subsequently ruled in August 2015 that the death penalty violated the state constitution The Court reaffirmed that holding in May 2016 and reiterated that the state  remaining death row prisoners must be resentenced to life without possibility of parole On August 2 2016 the Delaware Supreme Court held that the state  capital sentencing procedures were unconstitutional and struck down Delaware  death penalty statute On August 15 the Delaware Attorney General  office announced that it will not appeal the Supreme Court  ruling Whether the Supreme Court  decision applies to the 13 people facing active death sentences is still unknown On October 11 2018 the Washington Supreme Court declared the state  death penalty statute unconstitutional saying that it was applied in an arbitrary and racially discriminatory manner In May 2019 the New Hampshire legislature voted to abolish the death penalty However the repeal was not retroactive leaving one person on the state  death row View
