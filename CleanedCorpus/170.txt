States Are the  8216 ldest 8217  											 		 		 			 				 					 						 About 52 million Americans are age 65 or older according to the Census Bureau's 2018 population estimates  One quarter of these older Americans live in one of three states California Florida and Texas Seven other states—Georgia Illinois Michigan New York North Carolina Ohio and Pennsylvania—account for another one uarter of Americans age 65 or older These 10 states are also the most populous and include over half of the total U  population Sparsely populated states such as Alaska North Dakota South Dakota Wyoming and Vermont have very small older populations—less than 150 00 each in 2018 But the states with the most adults age 65 or older do not necessarily have the oldest population age profiles California is a relatively young state even though it has the largest number of older residents Only 14  of the state's total population was age 65 or older in 2018 In contrast 20  of Maine's population was age 65 or older the highest share of any state followed closely by Florida with 20   ee table    States Ranked by Percent of Population Age 65 or Older 2018 Rank State Total Resident Population  housands

Columbia's population and 20  of Puerto Rico's population in 2018 Source U  Census Bureau Vintage 2018 Population Estimates While southern states are regarded as retirement magnets states in the Northeast and Midwest have among the largest proportional shares of older adults What's driving these regional patterns Migration both internal and international has a large impact on the distribution of older adults States that have attracted older retirees such as Arizona Florida New Mexico and South Carolina have larger proportions of older residents Many states in the Midwest and Northeast also have large shares of older adults but for different reasons As young adults in these states have moved south and west looking for educational and job opportunities the older population is left to age in place In contrast California and Texas have been popular destinations for state o tate and international migrants  which has kept their populations relatively young The share of older adults will continue to increase as more members of the large baby boom cohort reach retirement age By 2040 26 states are projected to have age profiles similar to those of Florida and Maine today with at least 20 of their residents age 65 or older This demographic shift has implications for many federal and state programs that support older adults As more Americans become eligible for federal entitlement programs like Medicare and Social Security spending reductions and tax increases may be inevitable  8212 Excerpted from PRB's Population Bulletin "Elderly Americans  by Christine L Himes and updated
