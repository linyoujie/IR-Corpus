Michael Collins practises in the simulator in June 1969  one month before launch Fifty years on the Apollo Moon programme is probably still humankind  single greatest technological achievement On 16 July 1969 astronauts Neil Armstrong Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins were strapped into their Apollo spacecraft on top of the vast Saturn V rocket and were propelled into orbit in just over 11 minutes Four days later Armstrong and Aldrin became the first humans to set foot on the lunar surface Here  a visual guide to four lesser nown facts about the history aking mission 1 Saturn V is still the largest and most powerful rocket ever built Standing at more than 100m  63ft  the Saturn V rocket burned some 20 tonnes of fuel a second at launch Propellant accounted for 85 of its overall weight   think we were all surprised at how strong that thing was  Apollo 8 astronaut Frank Borman said in 2011 Astronaut Charlie Duke likened the feeling of stage separation  when parts of the spacecraft are jettisoned  to a  rain crash  Interactive Explore Apollo in 3D Saturn V Standing more than 100 metres tall the Saturn V rocket blasted astronauts Armstrong Aldrin and Collins into space in just over 11 minutes Lift off Stage One x27  five rocket engines burned 20 tonnes of kerosene and hydrogen fuel per second to power Apollo to 42 miles above the Earth Second stage Stage two fired to carry Apollo through the upper atmosphere at a speed of 15 00mph Beyond Earth Stage three fired twice  once to get Apollo into orbit  and then again to propel the spacecraft away from Earth towards the moon at a speed of 25 00mph Apollo The three astronauts sat in the Command Module Behind came the Service Module containing engines fuel tanks and fuel cells The Lunar Module The delicate moon landing craft was carried in stage three just behind the Command and Service Module Lunar manoeuvre Apollo performed a mid light flip to dock with the Lunar Module before turning once more and heading toward the Moon Image copyright NASA Image caption Saturn V Engineering on a vast scale Saturn V weighed 2 00 tonnes and generated 34 m Newtons   m pounds of thrust at launch That  enough to lift 130 tonnes into Earth orbit and send 43 tonnes to the Moon  the equivalent weight of almost four London buses How did the US put the first men on the Moon Will humans be back on the Moon by 2024  he greatest single broadcast in television history 2 Apollo  crew compartment was about the same size as a large car Armstrong Aldrin and Collins spent eight days together travelling about half a million miles to the Moon and back in a space roughly the size of a large car The astronauts were strapped into bench ike  ouches during launch and landing in the Command Module which measured 3 m  2 ft at its widest point It was no place for the claustrophobic Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The Command and Service Module of Apollo 17 pictured from the Lunar Module Behind the Command Module came the Service Module which contained fuel tanks and engines The Lunar Module  M or  em  was carried in a compartment behind the command and service modules Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The BBC  James Burke takes a look inside the Apollo Command Module Having left Earth Apollo performed a mid light turn to dock with the Lunar Module which was carried into space behind the Command Module before turning again and heading for the Moon 3 African merican women skilled in maths helped to work out the route to the Moon In the pre igital age Nasa employed a large number of female mathematicians as  uman computers  Many were African mericans Their work processing data and performing complicated calculations was critical to the success of the space programme Image copyright NASA Image caption Katherine Johnson pictured here in 1962 spent 33 years working for Nasa When the first computers appeared many of Nasa  early programmers and coders were these women The film Hidden Figures released in 2016 told the story of these maths wizards bringing their stories to a mass audience for the first time One woman in particular Katherine Johnson became known for her work calculating trajectories for the first Americans in space Alan Shepard and John Glenn and later for the Apollo Lunar Module and Command Module on flights to the Moon Apollo 11  flight path took the spacecraft into Earth orbit 11 minutes after launch Just over two hours later during its second orbit the rocket  third stage fired again to boost Apollo towards the moon  the so alled Trans Lunar Insertion or TLI The TLI placed Apollo on a  ree eturn trajectory  often illustrated as a figure of eight shape This course would have harnessed the power of the Moon  gravity to propel the spacecraft back to Earth without the need for more rocket fuel However when Apollo 11 neared its destination astronauts performed a braking manoeuvre known as  unar orbit insertion to slow the spacecraft and cause it to go into orbit around the Moon From there Armstrong and Aldrin descended to the surface 4 No ne knows where the Apollo 11 module is now A total of 10 lunar modules were sent into space and six landed humans on the moon Image copyright NASA Image caption Apollo 11  Lunar Module  agle begins its descent to the lunar surface Once used the ascent stages of the capsules were jettisoned and either crash anded on the moon burned up in Earth  atmosphere or  in one instance  went into orbit around the Sun But where exactly they ended up is not known in every case What happened to the Lunar Modules Mission Lunar Module Fate Apollo 5 Unnamed Burned up in Earth x27  atmosphere Apollo 9 Spider Burned up in Earth x27  atmosphere Apollo 10 Snoopy In orbit around the sun Apollo 11 Eagle Crash site unknown Apollo 12 Intrepid Crash anded on moon Apollo 13 Aquarius Used as a  x27 ifeboat x27  Apollo 14 Antares Crash anded on moon Apollo 15 Falcon Crash landed on moon Apollo 16 Orion Crash site unknown Apollo 17 Challenger Crash landed on moon  Apollo 13 x27  LM was used to help return the mission to Earth after an explosion damaged the Service Module Source Nasa The first two Lunar Modules were used in test flights and burned up in Earth  atmosphere Apollo 10  Lunar Module which went to the Moon but didn  land was jettisoned into space and went into orbit around the Sun Astronomers recently disclosed they were  8 sure they had located the drifting capsule  named Snoopy  some 50 years after its last sighting Image copyright NASA Apollo 13  Lunar Module performed a vital  ifeboat role when that mission had to be aborted following an explosion Most of the other modules  once they had safely returned astronauts back to the Command Module in lunar orbit  were dispatched to crash and back on the surface The crash sites of most are known  but no ne is quite sure where the ascent stages of Apollo 11  module Eagle or Apollo 16  module Orion ended up By Tom
