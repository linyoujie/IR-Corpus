scientists' competing explanations then perhaps we would have a different idea of why an apple falls to the ground  hoto Shutterstock Gravity it is all in your head We take it for granted that gravity pulls things towards the Earth But in reality this is just one of many explanations And they are all equally made up Niels Jakob Søe Loft PhD student department of Physics and Astronomy Aarhus University Denmark Published thursday 01 february 2018  06 5 Does gravity exist If I ask anyone that question they would look at me curiously and reply  dquo f course gravity exists rdquo We cannot see it with the naked eye but that doesn squo  mean it doesn squo  exist After all we see the effects of gravity It is the reason why things on Earth fall down while objects in space float around So how can I postulate that gravity doesn squo  exist Read More nbsp Can large objects exist in a quantum state 	Newton invents gravity If that apple had never hit Newton  head would we instead explain falling objects in terms of their energy and not gravity  llustration Shutterstock Let squo  go back in time to when gravity was first discovered It squo  1666 and Isaac Newton is sitting under an apple tree in Lincolnshire England his childhood home According to legend he sees an apple fall from the tree and this gets him thinking He asks himself why does the apple fall down to Earth The Earth must attract the apple he thinks And that is why it falls down He called this attraction gravity All massive objects attracts each other by gravity and this also allows Newton to explain the movement of the celestial bodies Newton squo  theory on gravity works extraordinarily well so you may well think that yes gravity must exist The principle of least action  llustration Niels Jakob Søe Loft But instead of saying that Newton  dquo iscovered dquo gravity we should instead say that he  dquo nvented dquo it Read More nbsp Cosmic neutrinos reveal the universe squo  violent history 	Disagreement in the orchard Imagine Newton sitting in the orchard with a friend  umour has it that he didn squo  have many  Let squo  call him Joseph ouis Lagrange Lagrange actually lived 100 years after Newton but that doesn squo  matter for the purposes of our thought experiment The important thing is that Lagrange takes a completely different approach to mechanics than Newton Both of them watch the apple fall And Newton who has just discovered gravity decides to challenge his friend With a sly smile he asks Lagrange to explain why the apple fell to the ground Newton waits in suspense to see whether Lagrange is clever enough to figure it out After some time Lagrange exclaims  dquo ha rdquo  dquo he apple falls because from an energy perspective it follows a stable path rdquo says Lagrange with confidence  dquo n the time it takes the apple to fall it follows a direct path towards the Earth rdquo notes Lagrange  dquo ut why does it follow a straight line In the same period of time it could have followed any other imaginable path rdquo Lagrange ascribes each possible path a quantity which he calls  dquo he action rdquo For any given path one can compute its action by looking at the apple squo  velocity and energy along that specific path Read More nbsp Tiny gravitational changes indicate loss of glacial ice Mathematically the action is the kinetic energy  nergy associated with movement minus the potential energy  nergy associated with position integrated over the time it takes to complete the motion along path Lagrange postulates that among the many possible routes the apple follows the path of least action It squo  is known as the principle of least action in physics In the case of an apple falling to the ground the straight line path that we observe is the one of least action This leaves Newton utterly confused as Lagrange talks about the apple squo  energy but does not name any type of attraction between the apple and the Earth But Lagrange does not need a force of attraction to describe the apple squo  fall As he sees it gravity only exists in Newton squo  head Newton cannot see anything wrong with Lagrange squo  analysis but he is confident in his own abilities and convinced that gravity is the correct explanation Lagrange must be wrong and his ideas on energy are surely pure fantasy Read More nbsp Gravitational ave astronomy will change our understanding of the universe 	More than one way to the same answer Before Newton and Lagrange come to blows another friend appears He suggests a simple experiment to resolve the conflict He will collect the apple and let it fall again He asks both of them to predict the time it takes to fall using their preferred method  dquo hus rdquo he says  dquo e can reveal which of you gentlemen is correct rdquo Both Newton and Lagrange grab a piece of paper and get to work Their mutual friend asks them to show their predictions and to their astonishment they both proclaim at the same time  dquo alf a second rdquo The two methods give the same answer and the experiment doesn squo  clear the matter up Read More  bsp ew satellite will test Einstein squo  theory 	Different explanations can be equally good For the rest of the day the three friends try to design an experiment that will reveal whether Newton squo  gravity or Lagrange squo  energy is the true explanation But time and time again both methods give the same answer By the evening they give up dash  sensible choice as there is no experiment that can tell the difference between the two methods They are completely equivalent They conclude that both methods are both right and wrong If Newton prefers to think about the apple squo  fall as a consequence of gravity then that is a valid model As Lagrange suggests it is nothing more than a model a  dquo omputational trick dquo if you will just like his own method They both agree on all of the physical parameters measured such as time of fall speed and so on Where they differ is the model used to explain it dash he mathematical apparatus they use to reach their identical predictions There are numerous mathematical formalisms that describe the same physics The packaging is different but they are equal as physical theories They always give the same measurable results The physicist Richard Feynman thought that every theoretical physicist should familiarise themselves with six or seven formalisms for the same physical phenomenon The smart physicist chooses the one that is easiest to work with or that gives the most insight into the problem Read More nbsp Dark matter how can we know if it exists 	Physics classes could have been very different In daily conversations the idea of gravity emerged as the winner This is probably due to the passage of history but also because it appears simple or more intuitive But it didn squo  have to be this way Had Newton never been born we could all have grown up learning about Lagrange squo  principle of least action or perhaps something else entirely It is fascinating to think that all of our language used in physics could have turned out very differently If we one day meet aliens from another world we will agree how an apple falls from a tree But we probably won squo  agree why 	        	 Read this article in Danish at ForskerZonen part of Videnskab k 	 bsp Translated by Catherine Jex External links Niels
