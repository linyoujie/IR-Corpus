programmable computer National Library of Wales ikimedia Commons 									 												 	 		 Advertisement 	 		 	 							 We could argue that the first computer was the abacus or its descendant the slide rule invented by William Oughtred in 1622 But the first computer resembling today  modern machines was the Analytical Engine  a device conceived and designed by British mathematician Charles Babbage between 1833 and 1871 Before Babbage came along a  uot omputer uot was a person someone who literally sat around all day adding and subtracting numbers and entering the results into tables The tables then appeared in books so other people could use them to complete tasks such as launching artillery shells accurately or calculating taxes  															 It was in fact a mammoth number runching project that inspired Babbage in the first place  ource Campbell elly   Napoleon Bonaparte initiated the project in 1790 when he ordered a switch from the old imperial system of measurements to the new metric system For 10 years scores of human computers made the necessary conversions and completed the tables Bonaparte was never able to publish the tables however and they sat collecting dust in the Académie des sciences in Paris 																			 	 	 																 In 1819 Babbage visited the City of Light and viewed the unpublished manuscript with page after page of tables If only he wondered there was a way to produce such tables faster with less manpower and fewer mistakes He thought of the many marvels generated by the Industrial Revolution If creative and hardworking inventors could develop the cotton gin and the steam locomotive then why not a machine to make calculations  ource Campbell elly   															 Babbage returned to England and decided to build just such a machine His first vision was something he dubbed the Difference Engine  which worked on the principle of finite differences or making complex mathematical calculations by repeated addition without using multiplication or division He secured government funding in 1824 and spent eight years perfecting his idea In 1832 he produced a functioning prototype of his table aking machine only to find his funding had run out 															 But as you might have guessed the story doesn  end there 													 				 				 					 				 					 						 																											 	 											 1
