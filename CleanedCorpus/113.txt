moonwalk  mage © NASA Neil Armstrong was a NASA astronaut most famous for being the first person to walk on the moon on July 20 1969 Armstrong also flew on NASA  Gemini 8 mission in 1966 He retired from NASA in 1971 and remained active in the aerospace community although he chose to keep mostly out of the public spotlight Armstrong died Aug 25 2012 at age 82 Armstrong was famously reticent about his accomplishments preferring to focus on the team that helped him get to the moon rather than his own first steps   guess we all like to be recognized not for one piece of fireworks but for the ledger of our daily work  Armstrong said in an interview with CBS   0 Minutes program in 2005 nbsp In another interview when asked what it feels like to have his footprints remain on the moon  surface for thousands of years Armstrong said   kind of hope that somebody goes up there one of these days and cleans them up  The Independent reported Early career and NASA work Armstrong was born in Wapakoneta Ohio on Aug 5 1930 to Stephen Koenig Armstrong and Viola Louise Engel nbsp Neil was a naval aviator from 1949 to 1952 and served in the Korean War He earned his bachelor of science degree in aeronautical engineering from Purdue University in 1955  any years later after he became world amous he also received a master of science in aerospace engineering from the University of Southern California in 1970  bsp Armstrong became a test pilot for NASA  hen known as NACA the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics and flew the X 5 a rocket owered missile haped aircraft that tested the limits of high ltitude flight During his long career as a pilot Armstrong flew more than 200 different aircraft from jets to gliders and even helicopters NASA test pilot Neil Armstrong is seen here next to the X 5 ship   after a research flight  mage credit NASA In 1962 Armstrong was selected to be part of NASA  second group of astronauts who flew on the two eat Gemini missions to test out space technology and the three eat Apollo missions that ultimately took 12 people to the surface of the moon Armstrong  first flight was as command pilot of the Gemini 8 mission in March 1966  dash the sixth crewed mission of that series nbsp Armstrong and pilot David Scott completed the first orbital docking of two spacecraft joining their Gemini 8 spacecraft to an uncrewed Agena target vehicle However the two an crew experienced a serious problem when a thruster on the Gemini 8 spacecraft became stuck open With the astronauts whipping around faster than one revolution per second Armstrong managed to gain control again by using the re ntry system thrusters The event was the first serious emergency in space and although the mission ultimately ended safely the spacecraft was forced to splash down early because the re ntry system was already expended Armstrong also narrowly avoided a nasty accident in May 1968 this time within Earth  atmosphere  while flying the Lunar Landing Research Vehicle  dash a machine that could fly somewhat like a lunar module and simulate landings on the moon Fuel for the attitude thrusters ran out and Armstrong was forced to eject just seconds before the vehicle crashed NASA reported  Armstrong escaped unharmed  mage credit NASA Apollo 11 and the first moonwalk The Apollo 11 crew members were announced to the public in January 1969 NASA  chief of the Astronaut Office Donald Kent  eke Slayton chose an all eteran team of Neil Armstrong  emini 8  Edwin  uzz Aldrin  emini 12 and Michael Collins  emini 10  with Armstrong selected to command the mission His responsibilities included landing on the moon alongside Aldrin the pilot of the lunar module Eagle Collins would remain in lunar orbit aboard the command module Columbia  ollins was originally supposed to be backup pilot for Apollo 11 but his spot in the flight sequence was moved after required surgery on his back forced him off the prime crew for Apollo 8  As the lander approached the moon Armstrong took over the controls when he saw that the computer was guiding them to a boulder illed landing zone At 4 4 p  EDT  014 GMT  Armstrong and Aldrin landed on the moon with only 25 seconds of fuel left Armstrong radioed  ouston Tranquility Base here The Eagle has landed  Capsule communicator and astronaut Charles Duke responded from Earth  oger … Tranquility we copy you on the ground You got a bunch of guys about to turn blue We e breathing again Thanks a lot  The schedule called for the astronauts to sleep before the first moonwalk but they elected to go outside early because they felt they would not be able to sleep In view of a black nd hite television camera transmitting his movements live to Earth Armstrong descended Eagle  lander and touched his left foot upon the surface at 10 6 p  EDT July 20  256 GMT July 21  His first words were  hat  one small step for a man one giant leap for mankind   he   was lost to radio static but later analysis of the sound wave showed that Armstrong did say it  Armstrong and Aldrin together explored the surface during a moonwalk that lasted 2 hours and 36 minutes They collected 48  pounds  2 kilograms of material from the surface  dash including 50 moon rocks  dash as well as deploying experiments planting the U  flag and taking a moment to speak with the U  president at the time Richard Nixon nbsp The Eagle  crew lifted off safely from the moon on July 21 docked with Columbia and voyaged back to Earth for a successful ocean landing on July 24 The astronauts went into quarantine to mitigate the  nlikely risk that they were carrying some sort of moon germs back with them and then embarked on a world tour to celebrate the mission After Apollo 11 and Armstrong  death After his time as an astronaut Armstrong was deputy associate administrator for aeronautics at NASA headquarters  He resigned from NASA in 1971 From 1971 to 1979 he was a professor of aerospace engineering at the University of Cincinnati Then from 1982 to 1992 Armstrong was chairman of Computing Technologies for Aviation Inc in Charlottesville Virginia Armstrong also participated in the Rogers Commission which was a presidential commission tasked to look at the causes and events of the fatal Challenger shuttle explosion of Jan 28 1986 that killed seven astronauts nbsp Armstrong chose to mostly stay out of the spotlight after leaving NASA although he did reappear periodically for interviews or for anniversary events concerning Apollo 11 Although his public statements were few he followed spaceflight news and occasionally made public comments on what was happening He remained a vocal supporter of suborbital spaceflight On the other hand the former Apollo astronaut was publicly critical of plans to shift crewed spaceflight from NASA to private spacecraft On Aug 7 2012  dash two days after Armstrong turned 82 years old  dash the famed moonwalker underwent coronary bypass surgery Complications from the surgery resulted in his death on Aug 25 nbsp  eil was our loving husband father grandfather brother and friend  his family wrote on the website neilarmstronginfo om  or those who may ask what they can do to honor Neil we have a simple request  they added  onor his example of service accomplishment and modesty and the next time you walk outside on a clear night and see the moon smiling down at you think of Neil Armstrong and give him a wink  Tributes poured in from many public figures including President Barack Obama Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney then ASA administrator Charles Bolden Apollo 11 crewmates Aldrin and Collins and various space representatives in the public private and nonprofit spheres nbsp  eil was among the greatest of American heroes  dash not just of his time but of all time  Obama  statement read   hen he and his fellow crew members lifted off aboard Apollo 11 in 1969 they carried with them the aspirations of an entire nation They set out to show the world that the American spirit can see beyond what seems unimaginable  dash that with enough drive and ingenuity anything is possible  A private memorial service for Armstrong was held Aug 31 2012 at the Camargo Club in Cincinnati Two weeks later a publicly televised memorial service was held at the National Cathedral in Washington D  nbsp Armstrong was buried at sea Sept 14 2012 in a ceremony aboard the guided missile cruiser USS Philippine Sea Armstrong  family was on board when the ship left port in Mayport Florida and they released his ashes somewhere in the Atlantic Ocean Obama ordered flags around the United States to fly at half taff on the day of the funeral Armstrong  legacy In 2015 the Smithsonian Institution revealed that Armstrong had kept aside a cloth bag full of small parts from the lunar module Eagle which lay undiscovered for decades until his widow Carol found it While Armstrong made no mention of this bag in decades of interviews the bag was discussed a few times during the mission nbsp It is unknown how Armstrong ultimately gained possession of the bag but it was common during the Apollo years for astronauts to retain souvenirs of their flights   month after Armstrong  death Obama made legal a bill to allow Mercury Gemini and Apollo astronauts to retain legal title to these mementos  Former  ythbusters host Adam Savage subsequently created a carry bag based on the design of Armstrong   urse  the design was actually used in several Apollo missions before and after Apollo 11 nbsp In a 2013 BBC documentary Armstrong  brother Dean said that he knew of the famous first words on the moon several months before Apollo 11 touched down Dean reported that Armstrong passed him a handwritten note as the brothers played a late ight game of Risk according to British newspaper the Telegraph However Dean  remarks contradicted many statements by Armstrong himself who said that the words didn  come to him until he arrived on the moon The other Apollo 11 astronauts have also backed up Armstrong  assertions Apollo 11 astronauts from left Michael Collins Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin stand in recognition of astronaut John Glenn during the U  House of Representatives Committee on Science Space and Technology tribute to the Apollo 11 astronauts at the Cannon House Office Building on Capitol Hill on July 21 2009 in Washington  mage credit NASA In 2017 a rare gold lunar model was stolen from the Armstrong Air and Space Museum in Wapakoneta  ntry to the museum was discovered and taken was a solid gold replica of the 1969 Lunar Excursion Module that landed on the moon  Russel Hunlock Wapakoneta police chief said in a release  he piece is very rare as it was presented to Neil Armstrong in Paris France shortly after the moon landing  bsp On Oct 12 2018 Universal Pictures released a Neil Armstrong biography based on James R Hansen  book  irst Man The Life of Neil A Armstrong  The movie starred Ryan Gosling as Armstrong The movie was embroiled in political controversy because the filmmakers decided not to include a scene where Armstrong plants an American flag on the moon  surface despite the fact that Armstrong did so in reality Sen Marco Rubio a Republican from Florida tweeted  his is total lunacy And a disservice at a time when our people need reminders of what we can achieve when we work together  bsp At the Venice Film Festival Gosling defended the filmmaker  choice reported The Telegraph  saying   think  he moon landing was widely regarded in the end as a human achievement  nd that  how we chose to view it
