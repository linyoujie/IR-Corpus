Christopher Columbus Didn  Get to America First And why it doesn  really matter if he was 500 years too late Author Daniel Luzer Updated Jun 14 2017 Original Oct 14 2013 Columbus Map drawn ca 1490 in the Lisbon workshop of Bartolomeo and Christopher Columbus  hoto Biblioth xE8 ue Nationale de France ikimedia Commons Today is the country x2019  official celebration of the 521st anniversary of Christopher Columbus x2019 landing at 2 o x2019 lock in the morning on October 12th somewhere in the Bahamas President Franklin D Roosevelt officially declared this day a federal holiday 75 years ago in 1937 though people began celebrating Columbus pos voyage before the American Revolution Since 1970 the holiday has occurred on the second Monday in October As Roosevelt said on this day in 1940  x201C olumbus and his fellow voyagers were the harbingers of later mighty movements of people from Spain from Columbus pos native Italy and from every country in Europe And out of the fusion of all these national strains was created   America  201D And as the patriotic song  x201C ail Columbia x201D puts it  x201C ail Columbia happy land Hail ye heroes heav pos  orn band Who fought and bled in freedom pos  cause Who fought and bled in freedom pos  cause  201D The Viking theory is not necessarily the most compelling Stories of New World visits come from places as diverse as Polynesia Japan Egypt Scotland Denmark Portugal Arabia Mali China and Ancient Rome But Columbus x2019 reputation didn x2019  fare so well over the course of his own life He died at the age of 55 in 1509 in the midst of a dispute with the Spanish Crown over his share of profits from the New World In the words of the American poet xA0 gden Nash  x201C olumbus said somebody show me the sunset and   he set sail for it nd he discovered America and they put him in jail for it nd the fetters gave him welts nd they named America after someone else  201D But by the 20th century with the Italian merican community eager for an official celebration of one of its own in the United States most of that was forgotten So we commemorated the day in the middle of October more or less happily as the official discovery of the Western Hemisphere Despite atrocities committed by the Spanish in the Americas not to mention well everyone else of European descent it was after all the first time any European had reached the New World And then things got complicated By the 500th anniversary celebration in 1992 when I was in middle school teachers were adding supplementary x2014 r corrective x2014 ectures to outdated textbooks When I was first officially introduced to the New World discovery in 5th grade the teacher explained that well no this Columbus story was actually all wrong An archeological discovery and extensive scholarship had by then confirmed that Columbus was not the first person from Europe to reach the New World Not at all The Vikings had reached Canada 500 years prior to his arrival While rumors of an early Scandinavian landing had been a longstanding if obscure Norse tale research had confirmed it by the 1960s In  x201C inland Ruins Prove Vikings Found the New World  201D published in the November 1964 issue of National Geographic Helge Ingstad an archeologist wrote of his discovery of ancient Norse settlements in Canada Just as this article goes to press a soapstone spindle whorl has been dug up at LAnse au Meadow Newfoundland indicating Viking settlers there included women Unquestionably Norse the small weight acted as a flywheel spinning a wooden shaft to twist raw wool into yarn The implement of a type common at Norse sites in Greenland Iceland and Norway was fashioned from a fragment of a charred cooking pot This spindle whorl thus becomes the earliest nown European household artifact yet found in North America It was unearthed at the L x2019 nse au Meadow site during the cleanup work L x2019 nse aux Meadows is a remote site in Newfoundland The Vikings occupied the area for less than a decade and were likely expelled by hostile natives who they called  uot kr xE6 ings quot Research seems to indicate Norse explorers and settlers didn x2019  really much impact indigenous technologies or culture Ingstad on what he found at the island The smithy where I stood betrayed itself by a queer hollow in a sandbank close to the brook Careful digging yielded fragments of worked iron and of the natural local bog iron Several hundred pieces of slag looked like the refuse from iron smelting This was important evidence in favor of the site being Norse for neither Eskimos nor Indians in the area knew how to smelt of hot orge iron Carbon 4 dating assigned the smithy to Viking days And it is very unlikely that later Europeans coming to these shores would have employed such a primitive smelting technique There were artifacts They were made using European technology And they were very old Eventually Ingstad recovered hundreds of Norse artifacts x2014  soapstone spindle whorl and a bronze inged pin process as well as other iron bronze stone and bone items x2014 t L pos nse aux Meadows Carbon dating confirmed that the items were made between 990 030 C  How did he come upon this Ingstad a Norwegian explorer who had spent most of his archeological career studying Northern and Arctic civilizations listened to the Norse sagas and interpreted what some saw as mythical maps literally L pos nse aux Meadows  HOTO WIKIMEDIA COMMONS A decade is a short period of time Indeed the occupation may have lasted as little as three years a shorter period of time than our own wars in Iraq and Afghanistan but it was enough time for even the settlers to start families The first European child born in the New World was probably not Mart xED  de Arg xFC lles born in St Augustine in 1566 to one of the colonists who went to xA0 lorida with Captain General xA0 edro Men xE9 dez de Avil xE9  but rather an Icelandic man named Snorri Thorfinnsson xA0 probably born between 1005 and 1013  the son of Thorfinnur Karlsefni and Gudr xED ur Eir xED sd xF3 tir in Newfoundland The fact that this Vineland news traveled around the world so quickly before the Internet is a testament to the power of compelling scholarship October 9 was Leif Ericson Day  an unofficial celebration of the day the Norse explorer landed somewhere in Canada though the actual date is still unknown It pos  not just the Scandinavians that told stories about travels to the New World Various cultures have legends about landing west of Europe In fact Columbus may have heard some of these while growing up giving him reason to think his prospect of sailing west of Spain might yield impressive results Cathay not withstanding The historical premise behind Madeline L x2019 ngle x2019  1978 young adult science fiction novel A Swiftly Tilting Planet  x2014  book very much geared toward America x2019  10 ear lds learning about Columbus x2014 s that early Welsh settlers came to America One Madoc xA0 r xA0 adog ab Owain Gwynedd was supposedly a xA0 elsh xA0 rince who sailed to xA0 merica xA0 n 1170 This rather than mere random genetic mutation is supposed to explain the occasional presence of blue yed Indians Mormon theology posited that the Native American population came to the continent not from a land bridge to Asia but rather from the 10 lost tribes of Israel  who supposedly came over in boats from Jerusalem in about 600 B   and split into two warring factions Even the Viking theory is not necessarily the most compelling Stories of New World visits come from places as diverse as Polynesia Japan Egypt Scotland Denmark Portugal Arabia Mali China and Ancient Rome Who got to America first We don x2019  really know the answer to this question As Alasdair Wilkins put it at io9 back in 2011 Between the first wave of human settlement of the Americas all those thousands of years ago and the arrival of Christopher Columbus in 1492 how many other groups reached the Americas And for that matter did any indigenous groups from the Americas ever travel to other continents To those questions science offers one easy answer one shaky but decent possibility a whole lot of racist claptrap and even more crazy speculation based on the flimsiest of evidence None of the evidence is very good but that doesn x2019  mean that early interaction didn x2019  occur  he Mormon lost ribes f srael theory is probably the most implausible They did archeological research about this in the 20th century and came up empty handed  But as Russell Freedom author of Who Was First Discovering the Americas  explains   uot t pos  a human instinct to know where you came from and what preceded you How did they get here Who were they The fact that we don pos  know for sure makes it quite fascinating quot What Columbus Day commemorates is not any more the actual discovery of the two continents that are North and South America but rather but the ambiguous  x201C anding  201D The holiday the New World celebrates is the transition of the region from a isolated and  elatively primitive region of hunter athers to the modern nation tate And it really was Columbus who set
