Engineering 					 			 		 	 	 		 																			 				 											 																 									 									 								 																			 Celebrating Penn Engineering History ENIAC 																		 Originally announced on February 14 1946 the Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer  NIAC  was the first general urpose electronic computer Hailed by The New York Times as  8220 n amazing machine which applies electronic speeds for the first time to mathematical tasks hitherto too difficult and cumbersome for solution  221 the ENIAC was a revolutionary piece of machinery in its day It was constructed and operated here at The Moore School of Electrical Engineering now part of the School of Engineering and Applied Science Today it is difficult to imagine how we could manage without the myriad electronic devices that we utilize each day From our smartphones touch screens and tiny cameras to our automobiles airplanes and medical equipment and devices electronics is the engine driving us forward And it was here at the University of Pennsylvania that it all began The School of Engineering and Applied Science is proud to have on display four of the original 40 panels of the ENIAC located on the ground floor of the Moore School Building  The artifacts represent approximately one enth of its original size 																	 							 								 			 													 				 											 								 																											 																																						 											 												 Preceding Technologies 												 											 											 												 													 Computation devices themselves are as ancient as the human race and their story has also been rehearsed all the way back to the earliest digital devices  8211 the fingers  8211 by way of piles of stones to  8220 apier 8217  Bones  221 an analogue device invented by the father of logarithms The abacus is still in use after 5 00 years while the slide rule invented in 1621 was only superseded by the modern computer Read on to learn about the inventions which contributed to the development of ENIAC and eventually the computers we use today Mechanical Brains  8211 These allowed humans to calculate larger mathematical operations faster than could be done  8220 n the head 8221 alone Examples of these are The Abacus Decks of beads and rods used to calculate addition subtraction division and multiplication along with being able to extract square and cube roots Learn more The Slide Rule Ruler haped device used to calculate multiplication and division along with more advanced functions such as logarithms and trigonometry Learn more  The Difference Engine Developed by Charles Babbage this machine was an automatic calculator used to calculate polynomial functions Learn more Mechanical Calculators Various calculating machines from desk op size to hand eld that allowed users to perform advanced mathematical functions Learn more  The Differential Analyser At Penn Engineering the Differential Analyser was in use and operated by secret human  8220 omputors  221 women during World War II who were employed at The Moore School doing ballistics calculations for the war effort The Differential Analyser is considered by many to be ENIAC 8217  closest relative Learn more  Vacuum Tubes  8211 used to create switches by manipulating the flow of electrons Common uses were found in early radio and television sets The better the tubes became the faster switches were able to be turned on and off This led to a faster computer because computers at the time relied on these switches Learn more  Punched Cards  8211 this technology was in the form of paper cards that contained digital information by the punched out holes in predetermined patterns on the cards These cards were used in such areas as fairgrounds  o operate the player ianos and organs to controlling the textile looms in industrial mills Punch cards were one of the earliest forms of data storage and programming of computers Learn more  												 											 										 																				 											 												 The Inventors John W Mauchly and J Presper Eckert Jr 												 											 											 												 													 The operators of the Differential Analyser  8211 the team of women dubbed  8220 uman computors 8221 and who were recruited and trained to run ballistics calculations for the war effort were not the only ones working under top secret conditions at The Moore School During the war interest in speeding up computation was underlined by the need to be able to calculate the speed and trajectory of bombs and missiles The government at this time funded a course taught at The Moore School called the Engineering Science Management War Training  SMWT course It offered instruction in electronics and other subject relevant to the war effort John Mauchly was a professor at Urisinus College when he enrolled in the course Later because of his outstanding performance at ESMWT he was hired at Penn to replace professors called away to active duty It was during this time that Mauchly met J Presper Eckert who was a graduate of Penn and hired to run the laboratory for the ESMWT course Both men were keenly interested in speeding up the ability to perform computations Despite the secret staffs of women at Penn and other locations there was a backlog of ballistics computation building up hampering the efforts of the troops fighting abroad After securing a contract from the military 8217  Ballistics Research Laboratory  RL  development of the ENIAC began Mauchly was very much the visionary of the ENIAC 8217  use of mechanical and vacuum tube technologies Eckert was the engineer of the project who solved it 8217  technical problems The chief challenge was tube reliability in the operation of ENIAC Eckert was able to get good reliability by running the tubes at one uarter power Together with a team of wiremen programmers and draftsmen the ENIAC was built When it was operational the machine was run by a team of six women For the next nine years the ENIAC served as the primary computing engine for the Army 												 											 										 																				 											 												 The Women of ENIAC 												 											 											 												 													 When ENIAC was finally unveiled at Penn in February 1946 two women had created the test run that wowed the media But their work and that of four other women who helped get ENIAC off the ground was literally erased Archival photos  uch as the one at the top of this page show both women and men working on the massive machine but the articles and pictures published at the time feature only men As modern engineers we now celebrate the contributions of Kathleen McNulty Mauchly Antonelli Jean Jennings Bartik Frances  etty Snyder Holberton Marlyn Wescoff Meltzer Frances Bilas Spence and Ruth Lichterman Teitelbaum These women were hired as civil service employees by the U  Army during World War II to calculate bullet and missile trajectories at the Ballistic Research Laboratory which consisted of staff from both the Army and The Moore School at Penn They then went on to become the developers and eventual programmers of ENIAC Kathleen McNulty Mauchly Antonelli graduated in 1942 from Chestnut Hill College with a degree in mathematics one of only a few mathematics majors out of a class of 92 women Jean Jennings Bartik attended Northwest Missouri State Teachers College  ow known Northwest Missouri State University  majoring in mathematics with a minor in English She graduated in 1945 with the only mathematics degree in her class Frances  etty Snyder Holberton studied journalism at the University of Pennsylvania and is credited with inventing breakpoints in computer debugging Marlyn Wescoff Meltzer graduated from Temple University in 1942 and was one of the two women who carried out the 1946 public demonstration of ENIAC Frances Bilas Spence was also a 1942 graduate of Chestnut Hill College with a degree in mathematics and a minor in physics Ruth Lichterman Teitelbaum graduated from Hunter College with a degree in Mathematics With Marlyn Meltzer she carried out the February 1946 public demonstration of ENIAC These women were among the very first programmers anywhere During the year it was operational at The Moore School they worked throughout each computation to direct ENIAC and its punch ard equipment programmed it for each job by plugging in cables and setting switches and partnered with scientists to develop programs for new problems Thanks to historians filmmakers and women in computer science who looked to them as role models the"ENIAC Six" gained much eserved recognition decades later and were inducted into the Women in Technology International Hall of Fame in 1997 To learn more about the contributions of these women click here  												 											 										 																				 											 												 What ENAIC Was and How it Worked 												 											 											 												 													 When fully operational ENIAC occupied a room 30 by 50 feet in size and weighed 30 tons A total of 40 panels were arranged in a U hape that measured 80 feet long at the front and the 18 00 vacuum tubes required were more than 20 times as many as the total employed by all various systems aboard a wartime B 9 bomber ENIAC 8217  circuits included 500 00 soldered joints with 70 00 resistors and 10 00 capacitors ENIAC also had its own dedicated power lines and used 150 kilowatts of electricity The operational characteristics of ENIAC included arithmetic memory and control elements Concerned with the arithmetic operations twenty accumulators for addition and subtraction a multiplier and a combination divider and square rooter The memory elements were composed of an  8220 nternal memory 8221 consisting of two parts the twenty ten igit accumulators and the 6 00 switches and cables on the function tables accumulators and  8220 onstant transmitters  221 The unlimited  8220 xternal memory 8221 was supplied from outside the machine in the form of punch cards The ENIAC now sits in the ground floor of the Moore Building appropriately part of a computer lab Now students sit within the shadow of its vacuum tubes and use descendants of ENIAC to accomplish their own tasks In the lab the parts of the ENIAC on display include the Cycling Unit the Master Programmer Unit a Function Table an Accumulator and Digit Trays Other parts of the original ENIAC were a Punch Card Reader a Card Puncher a Card Printer a Division Unit and a Square oot Unit After construction the ENIAC was shipped to the military 8217  Aberdeen Proving Ground in Aberdeen Maryland There it produced firing tables used for the military to correctly fire weapons at specific trajectories to accurately hit targets In addition to ballistics the ENIAC 8217  field of application included weather prediction atomic nergy calculations cosmic ay studies thermal ignition random umber studies wind unnel design and other scientific uses It is recalled that no electronic computers were being applied to commercial problems until about 1951 With the ability to perform math at blinding speed the ENIAC gave scientists a tool unlike any calculator that had come before The ballistics calculation that previously took 12 hours on a hand calculator could be done in just 30 seconds That means the ENIAC was faster by a factor of 1 40 Because of the associated drastic reduction in the cost of computing calculation ntensive research proceeded in directions previously unavailable This led to new consumer products and opened the vast new markets 												 											 										 																				 											 												 The ENIAC Effect Dawn of the Information Age 												 											 											 												 													 The first contribution of the ENIAC beyond its operational capacity was that it proved you could build a computer There had been many detractors of computing technologies but the success of Mauchly and Eckert inspired others to build improved computers As a result over the years computers were developed to be both smaller more capable and more affordable ENIAC led to EDVAC and soon IBM began making computers Vacuum tubes gave way to transistors and in turn led to smaller faster cheaper computers The integrated circuit paved the way for the microprocessor By the mid 970 8217  computers were starting to become affordable by average individuals Later computing networks formed IBM eventually produced the PC in 1981 The World Wide Web exploded onto the world in the mid 990 8217  and now wireless computing is ubiquitous New handheld devices are being developed to be smaller smarter and more powerful The march of technology continues on All thanks to the ENIAC
