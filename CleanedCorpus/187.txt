may not know about Alan Turing 					 						 Alan Turing 39  determination showed itself at an early age More 						 At the age of 14 he was due to start school at Sherborne School in Dorset His first day at school was also the first day of The General Strike in 1926 As there were no buses or trains running and he did not want to miss his first day at school Alan cycled the 60 miles to Sherborne 					 					 						 Alan has a long istance run named after him More 						 The Turing Relay is a long istance run along the riverside towpaths from Cambridge to Ely and back a route which Alan often used for training In the 1940s the best marathon time in the world was 2 hours 25 minutes Alan 39  personal best time was 2 hours 46 minutes 					 					 						 He was a very gifted athlete More 						 Alan Turing was renowned for his incredible ability as a long istance runner Whilst working at Bletchley Park he was sometimes required at important meetings in London On these days he would sometimes run the 40 miles to the meeting 					 					 						 Alan Turing has a number of roads and buildings named after him More 						 In 1994 a section of the A6010 Manchester inner ring road was renamed  39 lan Turing Way 39  A bridge which carries part of this road has been renamed the  39 lan Turing Bridge 39  The University of Surrey installed a statue of Alan Turing striding across the campus with books under his arm and renamed one of the roads in the Research Park as  39 uring Rd 39  The computer room at King 39  College Cambridge is now known as  39 he Turing Room 39 and the School of Technology building at Oxford Brookes University is known as  39 he Turing Building 39  Many other universities around the world have buildings and roads named after him 					 					 						 Alan Turing was voted one of the 100 Greatest Britons More 						 In 2002 Alan Turing was ranked twenty irst on the BBC nationwide poll of the 100 Greatest Britons 					 					 						 He was a man ahead of his time More 						 In 1952 he developed a Chess programme for a computer that did not yet exist Having no computer powerful enough to execute the program Alan played a game in which he simulated the computer taking about half an hour per move The program lost to his colleague Alick Glennie 					 					 						 Alan Turing was involved in the early development of Artificial Intelligence More 						 He was very interetsed in the idea of artificial intelligence and designed an experiment which is nowadays known as the Turing test It is an attempt to find a standard for a machine to be called  39 ntelligent 39  					 					 						 Alan is said to have taught himself to read in three weeks More 						 Even though traditional adults sometimes found the young Alan Turing rather difficult there is common agreement on that his high intelligence showed itself at an early age 					 		 		 			 Alan Turing in brief 			 				 				 					 This man was a national treasure and we hounded him to his death  I  looking for an apology from the British government because that  where I think the wrong was done But Turing is clearly someone of international stature â€“ John Graham umming computer scientist 					 			 			 Alan Turing is often called the father of modern computing He was a brilliant mathematician and logician He developed the idea of the modern computer and artificial intelligence During the Second World War he worked for the government breaking the enemies codes and Churchill said he shortened the war by two years Born in London in 1912 Alan Turing attended Sherborne School in Dorset and then later King  College Cambridge and Princeton University in the USA nbsp At the outbreak of World War Two Alan joined the Government Codes and Cypher School at Bletchley Park He worked on bsp reaking the code for the German Enigma machine a device for sending coded messages to units of the German forces Alan developed a machine  he Bombe which bsp elped break the code He also went on to break the Naval Enigma an even more complicated machine His wartime services helped to win the war but his work was so secret that very few people were aware of the importance of what he had done at Bletchley Park Alan Turing went on to become deputy director of the computing lab at Manchester University He sadly died too young in tragic circumstances a victim of the discriminatory laws of the day It is often wondered how much further ahead computing would be if he had lived Picture Gallery Alan Turing 			 		 							 						 					 				 			 		 			 E2B eg and E2BN eg are registered trade marks
