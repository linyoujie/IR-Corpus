first commercially produced digital computer is dedicated On June 14 1951 the U  Census Bureau dedicates UNIVAC the world x2019  first commercially produced electronic digital computer UNIVAC which stood for Universal Automatic Computer was developed by J Presper Eckert and John Mauchly makers of ENIAC the first general urpose electronic digital computer These giant computers which used thousands of vacuum tubes for computation were the forerunners of today x2019  digital computers The search for mechanical devices to aid computation began in ancient times The abacus developed in various forms by the Babylonians Chinese and Romans was by definition the first digital computer because it calculated values by using digits A mechanical digital calculating machine was built in France in 1642 but a 19th century Englishman Charles Babbage is credited with devising most of the principles on which modern computers are based His  x201C nalytical Engine  201D begun in the 1830s and never completed for lack of funds was based on a mechanical loom and would have been the first programmable computer By the 1920s companies such as the International Business Machines Corporation  BM were supplying governments and businesses with complex punch ard tabulating systems but these mechanical devices had only a fraction of the calculating power of the first electronic digital computer the Atanasoff erry Computer  BC  Completed by John Atanasoff of Iowa State in 1939 the ABC could by 1941 solve up to 29 simultaneous equations with 29 variables Influenced by Atanasoff x2019  work Presper Eckert and John Mauchly set about building the first general urpose electronic digital computer in 1943 The sponsor was the U  Army Ordnance Department which wanted a better way of calculating artillery firing tables and the work was done at the University of Pennsylvania  ENIAC which stood for Electronic Numerical Integrator and Calculator was completed in 1946 at a cost of nearly  00 00 It took up 15 00 feet employed 17 00 vacuum tubes and was programmed by plugging and replugging some 6 00 switches It was first used in a calculation for Los Alamos Laboratories in December 1945 and in February 1946 it was formally dedicated Following the success of ENIAC Eckert and Mauchly decided to go into private business and founded the Eckert auchly Computer Corporation They proved less able businessmen than they were engineers and in 1950 their struggling company was acquired by Remington Rand an office equipment company On June 14 1951 Remington Rand delivered its first computer UNIVAC I to the U  Census Bureau It weighed 16 00 pounds used 5 00 vacuum tubes and could perform about 1 00 calculations per second On November 4 1952 the UNIVAC achieved national fame when it correctly predicted Dwight D Eisenhower x2019  unexpected landslide victory in the presidential election after only a tiny percentage of the votes were in UNIVAC and other first eneration computers were replaced by transistor computers of the late 1950s which were smaller used less power and could perform nearly a thousand times more operations per second These were in turn supplanted by the integrated ircuit machines of the mid 960s and 1970s In the 1980s the development of the microprocessor made possible small powerful computers such as the personal computer and more recently the laptop and hand eld computers Citation Information Article Title UNIVAC the first commercially produced digital computer is dedicated Author History om Editors Website Name HISTORY URL https  ww
