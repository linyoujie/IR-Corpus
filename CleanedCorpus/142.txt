Share via Email Print this page Christopher is credited with discovering the Americas in 1492 Americans get a day off work on October 10 to celebrate Columbus Day  It  an annual holiday that commemorates the day on October 12 1492 when the Italian explorer Christopher Columbus officially set foot in the Americas and claimed the land for Spain It has been a national holiday in the United States since 1937 It is commonly said that  olumbus discovered America  It would be more accurate perhaps to say that he introduced the Americas to Western Europe during his four voyages to the region between 1492 and 1502 It  also safe to say that he paved the way for the massive influx of western Europeans that would ultimately form several new nations including the United States Canada and Mexico But to say he  iscovered America is a bit of a misnomer because there were plenty of people already here when he arrived And before Columbus So who were the people who really deserve to be called the first Americans VOA asked Michael Bawaya the editor of the magazine American Archaeology  He told VOA that they came here from Asia probably  o later than about 15 00 years ago  They walked across the Bering land bridge that back in the day connected what is now the U  state of Alaska and Siberia Fifteen housand years ago ocean levels were much lower and the land between the continents was hundreds of kilometers wide Beringia land bridge Beringia land bridge The area would have looked much like the land on Alaska  Seward Peninsula does today treeless arid tundra But despite its relative inhospitality life abounded there According to the U  National Park Service  he land bridge played a vital role in the spread of plant and animal life between the continents Many species of animals  the woolly mammoth mastodon scimitar cat Arctic camel brown bear moose muskox and horse — to name a few — moved from one continent to the other across the Bering land bridge Birds fish and marine mammals established migration patterns that continue to this day  And archaeologists say that humans followed in a never nding hunt for food water and shelter Once here humans dispersed all across North and eventually Central and South America Up until the 1970s these first Americans had a name the Clovis peoples They get their name from an ancient settlement discovered near Clovis New Mexico dated to over 11 00 years ago And DNA suggests they are the direct ancestors of nearly 80 percent of all indigenous people in the Americas But there  more Today it  widely believed that before the Clovis people there were others and as Bawaya says  hey haven  really been identified  But there are remants of them in places as far lung as the U  states of Texas and Virginia and as far south as Peru and Chile We call them for lack of a better name the Pre lovis people And to make things more complicated recent discoveries are threatening to push back the arrival of humans in North America even further back in time Perhaps as far back as 20 00 years or more But the science on this is far from settled Back to the Europeans So for now the Clovis and the Pre lovis peoples long disappeared but still existent in the genetic code of nearly all native Americans deserve the credit for discovering America But those people arrived on the western coast What about arrivals from the east Was Columbus the first European to glimpse the untamed verdant paradise that America must have been centuries ago A reconstruction of the viking settlement in Newfo A reconstruction of the Viking settlement in Newfoundland Not even close There is proof that Europeans visited what is now Canada about 500 years before Columbus set sail They were Vikings and evidence of their presence can be found on the Canadian island of Newfoundland at a place called l nse Aux Meadows  It is now a UNESCO World Heritage site and consists of the remains of eight buildings that were likely wooden structures covered with grass and soil Today the area is barren but a thousand years ago there were trees everywhere and the area likely was used as winter stopover point where Vikings repaired their boats and sat out bad weather It  not quite clear if the area was a permanent settlement but it is clear that the expansion inded Norsemen were here long before Columbus One final mystery And to add one fascinating wrinkle to the story of America  discover consider the Sweet Potato  The Sweet Potato native to S America was around The sweet potato native to South America was around in Polynesia 1 00 years ago  redit Miya Yes that  right the sweet potato This humble pinkish ed tuber is native to South America And yet there have been sweet potatoes on the menu in Polynesia as far back as 1 00 years ago So how did it get there By comparing the DNA of Polynesian and South American sweet potatoes scientists think it  clear that someone either brought them back to Polynesia after visiting South America or islanders brought them from South America when they were exploring the Pacific Ocean Either way it suggests that about the same time Nordic sailors were cutting trees in Canada someone in Polynesia was trying sweet potatoes from South America for the first time Speaking of genetics a 2014 study of the DNA of natives on the Polynesian island of Rapa Nui also known as Easter Island found a fair amount of Native American genes in the mix The entry of American DNA into the genetics of the Rapa Nui natives suggests that the two peoples were living together around 1280 AD There are other theories out there A retired British Naval officer named Gavin Menzies has been pushing the idea that the Chinese colonized South America in 1421 Another theory from a retired chemist named John Ruskamp suggests that pictographs discovered in Arizona are nearly identical to Chinese characters He puts the Chinese in the U  state of Arizona sometime around 1300 BC We mention these two only because we have seen them pop up in newspaper articles recently They e thoroughly discredited so we l leave it at that A melting pot indeed So what to make of all this Well here at VOA we are trying to tell the story of America And what is clear is that America was a melting pot hundreds of years before the Statue of Liberty began urging the world  ive me your tired your poor your huddled masses yearning to breathe free  In fact the entirety of North and South America are a polyglot of cultures stretching back before recorded history And people have been coming here ever since chasing a better life abundant food water and opportunity Today maybe not that much has changed Related Stories USA Battlefield Archaeologists Find Oregon Indian War Anything But Ancient History Archeologists
