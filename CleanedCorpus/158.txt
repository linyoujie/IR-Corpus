objects to deviate from traveling a straight line The distortion causes the objects that were moving along a flat plane to fall into a spherical path  mage credit koya979 Shutterstock  Gravity is the force that attracts two bodies toward each other the force that causes apples to fall toward the ground and the planets to orbit the sun The more massive an object is the stronger its gravitational pull Fundamental force Gravity is one of the four fundamental forces along with the electromagnetic strong and weak forces It is what causes objects to have weight When you weigh yourself the scale tells you how much gravity is acting on your body The formula for determining weight is weight equals mass times gravity On Earth gravity is a constant 9  meters per second squared or 9  m  2  Historically philosophers such as Aristotle thought that heavier objects accelerate toward the ground faster But later experiments showed that wasn  the case The reason that a feather will fall more slowly than a bowling ball is because of the drag from air resistance which acts in the opposite direction as the acceleration due to gravity Newton  Law of Universal Gravitation says that the force of gravity is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them  mage credit marekuliasz Shutterstock  Sir Isaac Newton developed his Theory of Universal Gravitation in the 1680s He found that gravity acts on all matter and is a function of both mass and distance Every object attracts every other object with a force that is proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them The equation is often expressed as F g  G   1  8729 m 2   r 2 Fg is the gravitational force m1 and m2 are the masses of the two objects r is the distance between the two objects G is the universal gravitational constant Newton  equations work extremely well to predict how objects such as planets in the solar system behave Theory of relativity Newton published his work on gravitation in 1687 which reigned as the best explanation until Einstein came up with his theory of general relativity in 1915 nbsp In Einstein  theory gravity isn  a force but rather the consequence of the fact that matter warps space ime One prediction of general relativity is that light will bend around massive objects Fun facts The gravity on the moon is about 16 percent of that on Earth Mars has about 38 percent of Earth  pull while the biggest planet in the solar system Jupiter has 2  times the gravity of Earth Though nobody  iscovered gravity legend has it that famous astronomer Galileo Galilei did some of the earliest experiments with gravity dropping balls off the Tower of Pisa to see how fast they fell Isaac Newton was just 23 years old and back from university when he noticed an apple falling in his garden and began unraveling the mysteries of gravity  t  probably a myth that the apple bonked him on the head though  An early measure of Einstein  theory of relativity was the bending of starlight near the sun during a solar eclipse on May 29 1919 Black holes are massive collapsed stars with such strong gravity that even light cannot escape from it Einstein  theory of general relativity is incompatible with quantum mechanics the bizarre laws that govern the behavior of the tiny particles  dash such as photons and electrons  dash that make up the universe Follow Tia Ghose on Twitter and Google   bsp Follow  bsp LiveScience  ivescience  Facebook  bsp  mp Google
