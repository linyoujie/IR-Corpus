gravitational waves we look back on how our grasp of gravity has evolved over the centuries 1687 Newtonian gravity Isaac Newton publishes Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica  giving a comprehensive account of gravity This gave astronomers an accurate toolbox for predicting the motions of planets But it was not without its problems such as calculating the precise orbit of the planet Mercury All planets' orbits precess – with the closest point of their orbit moving slightly with each revolution – due to the gravitational tugs from other planets Wes Mountain he Conversation  CC BY D The issue with Mercury's orbit was that the amount of precession did not match what Newton's theory predicted It was only a small discrepancy but big enough for astronomers to know it was there Wes Mountain he Conversation  CC BY D 1859 Planet Vulcan To explain Mercury's odd behaviour Urbain Le Verrier proposed the existence of an unseen planet called  ulcan https  n ikipedia rg iki ulcan hypothetical lanet  which orbited closer to the sun He suggested that the gravity from Vulcan was influencing Mercury's orbit But repeated observations revealed no signs of Vulcan Wes Mountain he Conversation  CC BY D 1905 Special relativity Albert Einstein shakes up physics with his special theory of relativity  He then started incorporating gravity into his equations which led to his next breakthrough 1907 Einstein predicts gravitational redshift What we now call gravitational redshift was first proposed by Einstein from his thoughts in the development of general relativity Wes Mountain he Conversation  CC BY D Einstein predicted that the wavelength of light coming from atoms in a strong gravitational field will lengthen as it escapes the gravitational force The longer wavelength shifts the photon to the red end of the electromagnetic spectrum 1915 General relativity Albert Einstein publishes general theory of relativity  The first great success was its accurate prediction of Mercury's orbit including its previously inscrutable precession The theory also predicts the existence of black holes and gravitational waves  although Einstein himself often struggled to understand them Wes Mountain he Conversation  CC BY D 1917 Einstein theorises stimulated emission In 1917 Einstein publishes a paper on the quantum theory of radiation indicating stimulated emission was possible Einstein proposed that an excited atom could return to a lower energy state by releasing energy in the form of photons in a process called spontaneous emission In stimulated emission an incoming photon interacts with the excited atom causing it to move to a lower energy state releasing photons that are in phase and have the same frequency and direction of travel as the incoming photon This process allowed for the development of the laser  ight amplification by stimulated emission of radiation  1918 Prediction of frame dragging Josef Lense and Hans Thirring theorise that the rotation of a massive object in space would"drag" spacetime around with it 1919 First observation of gravitational lensing Gravitational lensing is the bending of light around massive objects such as a black hole allowing us to view objects that lie behind it During a total solar eclipse in May 1919 stars near the sun were observed slightly out of position This indicated that light was bending due to the sun's mass Wes Mountain he Conversation  CC BY D 1925 First measurement of gravitational redshift Walter Sydney Adams examined light emitted from the surface of massive stars and detected a redshift as Einstein predicted 1937 Prediction of a galactic gravitational lensing Swiss astronomer Fritz Zwicky proposed that an entire galaxy could act as a gravitational lens 1959 Gravitational redshift verified The theory was conclusively tested by Robert Pound and Glen Rebka by measuring the relative redshift of two sources at the top and bottom of Harvard University's Jefferson Laboratory tower The experiment accurately measured the tiny change in energies as photons travelled between the top and the bottom Wes Mountain he Conversation  CC BY D 1960 Laser invented using stimulated emission Theodore H Maiman  a physicist at Hughes Research Laboratories in California builds the first laser 1960s First evidence for black holes The 1960s was the beginning of the renaissance of general relativity and saw the discovery of galaxies that were powered by the immense pull of black holes in their centres There is now evidence of massive black holes in the hearts of all large galaxies as well as there being smaller black holes roaming between the stars 1966 First observation of gravitational time delays American astrophysicist Irwin Shapiro proposed that if general relativity is valid then radio waves will be slowed down by the sun's gravity as they bounce around the solar system Wes Mountain he Conversation  CC BY D The effect was observed between 1966  by bouncing radar beams off the surface of Venus and measuring the time taken for the signals to return to Earth The delay measured agreed with Einstein's theory We now use time elays on cosmological scales looking at the time differences in flashes and flares between gravitationally lensed images to measure the expansion of the universe 1969 False detection of gravitational waves American physicist Joseph Weber   bit of a rebel claimed the first experimental detection of gravitational waves His experimental results were never reproduced Wes Mountain he Conversation  CC BY D 1974 Indirect evidence for gravitational waves Joseph Taylor and Russell Hulse discover a new type of pulsar a binary pulsar Measurements of the orbital decay of the pulsars showed they lost energy matching the amounts predicted by general relativity They receive the 1993 Nobel Prize for Physics for this discovery Wes Mountain he Conversation  CC BY D 1979 First observation of a galactic gravitational lens The first extragalactic gravitational lens was discovered when observers Dennis Walsh  Bob Carswell and Ray Weymann saw two identical quasi tellar objects or"quasars" It turned out to be one quasar that appears as two separate images Since the 1980s gravitational lensing has become a powerful probe of the distribution of mass in the universe 1979 LIGO receives funding US National Science Foundation funds construction of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational ave Observatory  IGO  1987 Another false alarm for gravitational waves A false alarm on direct detection from Joseph Weber  gain with claimed signal from the supernova SN 1987A using his torsion bar experiments  which consisted of large aluminium bars designed to vibrate when a large gravitational wave passed through it 1994 LIGO construction begins It took a long time but the construction of LIGO finally began in Hanford Washington and Livingston Louisiana 2002 LIGO starts first search In August 2002 LIGO starts searching for evidence of gravitational waves 2004 Frame dragging probe NASA launches Gravity Probe B to measure the spacetime curvature near the Earth The probe contained gyroscopes that rotated slightly over time due to the underlying spacetime The effect is stronger around a rotating object which"drags" spacetime around with it Wes Mountain he Conversation  CC BY D The gyroscopes in Gravity Probe B rotated by an amount consistent with Einstein's theory of general relativity Wes Mountain he Conversation  CC BY D 2005 LIGO hunt ends After five searches the first phase of LIGO ends with no detection of gravitational waves The sensors then undergo an interim refit to improve sensitivity called Enhanced LIGO 2009 Enhanced LIGO An upgraded version called Enhanced LIGO starts new hunt for gravitational waves 2010 Enhanced LIGO hunt ends Enhanced LIGO fails to detect and gravitational waves A major upgrade called Advanced LIGO begins 2014 Advanced LIGO upgrade completed The new Advanced LIGO has finished installation and testing and is nearly ready to begin a new search 2015 False alarm   for gravitational waves The indirect signature of gravitational waves in the early universe was claimed by the BICEP2 experiment  looking at the cosmic microwave background But it looks like this was dust in our own galaxy spoofing the signal 2015 LIGO upgraded again Advanced LIGO starts a new hunt for gravitational waves with four times the sensitivity of the original LIGO In September it detects a signal that looks likely to be from the collision between two black holes 2016 Gravitational wave detection confirmed After rigorous checks the Advanced LIGO team announce the detection of gravitational waves Wes Mountain he Conversation  CC BY D General Relativity Einstein
