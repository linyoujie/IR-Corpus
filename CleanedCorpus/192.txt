guarantees of French and British military support should it be attacked by Germany Hitler intended to invade Poland anyway but first he had to neutralize the possibility that the Soviet Union would resist the invasion of its western neighbour Secret negotiations led on August 23–24 to the signing of the German oviet Nonaggression Pact in Moscow  In a secret protocol of this pact the Germans and the Soviets agreed that Poland should be divided between them with the western third of the country going to Germany and the eastern two hirds being taken over by the U    Having achieved this cynical agreement the other provisions of which stupefied Europe even without divulgence of the secret protocol Hitler thought that Germany could attack Poland with no danger of Soviet or British intervention

temporary agreement caused him to postpone the start of hostilities for a few days He was still determined however to ignore the diplomatic efforts of the western powers to restrain him Finally at 12 0 pm on August 31 1939 Hitler ordered hostilities against Poland to start at 4 5 the next morning The invasion began as ordered In response Great Britain and France declared war on Germany on September 3 at 11 0 am and at 5 0 pm  respectively World War II had begun Get exclusive access to content from our 1768 First Edition with your subscription Subscribe today
