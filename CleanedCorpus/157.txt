Apple 39  Mission Statement Share Pin Email By Barbara Farfan Updated November 20 2019 Technology company   Apple Inc has evolved over the years from a relatively niche producer of personal computers into a diversified maker of electronic devices and provider of services that is one of the most highly valued publicly traded companies in the world The company 39  mission statement and other statements of values and visions have also changed since the company 39  incorporation—as Apple Computer Inc by Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak on January 3 1977 Apple is dedicated to the empowerment of man—to making personal computing accessible to each and every individual so as to help change the way we think work learn and communicate That was Apple 39  original mission statement according to marketing guru and Interbrand Pacific founder David Andrew In  34 Brand Revitalisation and Extension   4 a chapter in the book  34 Brands The New Wealth Creators   4 Andrew wrote that the mission statement sprang from the company 39  brand vision statement Man is the true creator of change in this world As such he should be above systems and structures and not subordinate to them Steve Jobs 39 Application of the Mission Statement The LIFE Picture Collection via Getty Images  Getty Images You can see in those lines the origins of  Jobs 39 simpler guiding principle  or brand vision for the company during the 1980s To make a contribution to the world by making tools for the mind that advance humankind Jobs again spoke of computers as being tools for our minds in the 1990 documentary film  34 emory and Imagination New Pathways to the Library of Congress 34  I think one of the things that really separates us from the high primates is that we're tool builders I read a study that measured the efficiency of locomotion for various species on the planet The condor used the least energy to move a kilometer And humans came in with a rather unimpressive showing about a third of the way down the list It was not too proud a showing for the crown of creation So that didn't look so good But then somebody at  34 cientific American 34 had the insight to test the efficiency of locomotion for a man on a bicycle And a man on a bicycle a human on a bicycle blew the condor away completely off the top of the charts And that's what a computer is to me What a computer is to me is it's the most remarkable tool that we've ever come up with and it's the equivalent of a bicycle for our minds In 1998 Jobs talked about his mantra of simplicity during an interview with  34 usinessweek 34  That's been one of my mantras—focus and simplicity Simple can be harder than complex You have to work hard to get your thinking clean to make it simple But it 39  worth it in the end because once you get there you can move mountains Tim Cook 39  Vision for Apple Drew Angerer  Getty Images Tim Cook Jobs 39 chosen successor and current Apple CEO touched on simplicity as well as many other aspects of his vision for the company right after he was named acting CEO in 2009 while Jobs went on medical leave We believe that we 39 e on the face of the Earth to make great products and that 39  not changing We 39 e constantly focusing on innovating We believe in the simple not the complex We believe that we need to own and control the primary technologies behind the products we make and participate only in markets where we can make a significant contribution We believe in saying no to thousands of projects so that we can really focus on the few that are truly important and meaningful to us We believe in deep collaboration and cross ollination of our groups which allow us to innovate in a way that others cannot And frankly we don 39  settle for anything less than excellence in every group in the company and we have the self onesty to admit when we 39 e wrong and the courage to change And I think regardless of who is in what job those values are so embedded in this company that Apple will do extremely well  obs had spoken of the importance of saying no to projects at the 1997 Apple Worldwide Developers Conference  34  39  actually as proud of the things we haven 39  done as the things I have done Innovation is saying  39 o 39 to 1 00 things  4  In 2016 Cook brought up the common Apple theme of providing tools for empowerment during an interview with  34 he Indian Express 34   For us the most important thing we can do is raise people up that is either by giving the ability to do things they could not otherwise do allow them to create things they couldn't otherwise create It's about giving them tools it is about empowering people I think to me that is the primary objective of technology—for you to live better longer Apple  doesn 39  currently have an official mission statement on its website but company press releases end with the following statement that mentions empowerment And its last sentence could serve as a mission statement Apple revolutionized personal technology with the introduction of the Macintosh in 1984 Today Apple leads the world in innovation with iPhone iPad Mac Apple Watch and Apple TV Apple's four software platforms—iOS macOS watchOS and tvOS—provide seamless experiences across all Apple devices and empower people with breakthrough services including the App Store Apple Music Apple Pay and iCloud Apple's more than 100 00 employees are
