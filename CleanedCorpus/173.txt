complete untold history of how mankind came to the Americas—offering new revelations and a radical rethinking of the accepted historical record in Who Discovered America The iconoclastic historian's magnum opus Who Discovered America calls into question our understanding of how the American continents were settled shedding new light on the well nown"discoveries" of European explorers including Christopher Columbus In Who Discovered America he combines meticulous research and an adventurer's spirit to reveal astounding new evidence of an ancient Asian seagoing tradition—most notably the Chinese—that dates as far back as 130 00 years ago Menzies offers a revolutionary new alternative to the"Beringia" theory of how humans crossed a land bridge connecting Asia and North America during the last Ice Age and provides a wealth of staggering claims that hold fascinating and astonishing implications for the history of mankind  Read more ISBN 9780062236784 ISBN 10 0062236784 Imprint
