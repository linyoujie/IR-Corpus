Technology Explained Who Invented the First Computer and When We Investigate Dan Price March 7 2019 07 3 019 6 minutes Who Invented the First Computer and When We Investigate Advertisement When was the first computer invented It sounds like it should be a simple question to answer right It squo  not so straightforward you squo l get different answers depending on who you ask Keep reading to find out more Defining  dquo omputer dquo The question of who invented the first computer is greatly influenced by how you define the word There squo  some disagreement even among dictionary publishers Here squo  how the UK squo  Oxford English Dictionary defines it  dquo n electronic device for storing and processing data typically in binary form according to instructions given to it in a variable program rdquo And here squo  how Merriam ebster defines  dquo omputer dquo in the U    dquo  programmable usually electronic device that can store retrieve and process data rdquo The critical difference is Merriam ebster squo  ambiguity over whether a computer needs to be electronic to meet the criteria Most experts agree that computers can be sub ivided into analog computers and digital computers Analog computers do not necessarily need an electrical supply Depending on your opinion many different contenders for the honor emerge Who Invented the First Computer Image Credit Wikimedia Commons The most commonly ited name when considering who invented the first computer is Charles Babbage Babbage  791 871 was a British Polymath He specialized in several fields including mathematics and mechanical engineering His two most notable machines were the Difference Engine and the Analytical Engine The Difference Engine  tarted in 1822 could compute values of polynomial functions to aid navigation the more complex Analytical Engine  roposed in 1837 was the first computer that could be considered  dquo uring complete dquo  The Analytical Engine had many of the same traits as a modern computer included a precursor to a CPU  hich Babbage called the  dquo ill dquo  and memory  alled the  dquo tore dquo  Babbage never had enough funding to build the Analytical Engine In 1991 the London Science Museum finally built a complete and working model of the machine using techniques that were available in Babbage squo  time Computing in Ancient Times Image Credit Wikimedia Commons Although Babbage is rightly considered to be the father of modern computing two ancient devices are often thought to be the first analog computers the south ointing chariot in China and the Antikythera mechanism in Greece The south ointing chariot was an adaptation of a 5th century BC armored carriage called the Dongwu Che The south ointing feature was added around the 1st century BC It did not use magnets the direction was set at the start of a journey and relied on a gear system linked to the wheels to adjust its heading The Antikythera mechanism was an orrery  sed to determine astronomical positions  It was discovered in 1901 on a shipwreck in the Greek islands The device has been dated to sometime between 205 BC and 60 BC It contained more than 30 meshing gear wheels a fixed ring dial and a hand crank After the collapse of Ancient Greece the technology was lost for more than a millennium It wasn squo  until the arrival of mechanical astronomical clocks in Europe in the 14th century that civilization saw similar levels of technological complexity When Was the First Programmable Computer Invented German pioneer Konrad Zuse built the world squo  first programmable computer dash ubbed the Z1 dash n Berlin between 1935 and 1938 The Z1 could read instructions from a perforated 35 mm film but never worked efficiently due to inaccuracies in the 30 00 metal parts The computer was destroyed in an air raid during World War II Undeterred Zuse went on to create the Z2  940  Z3  941  and Z4  949  The Z3 was the world squo  first working programmable fully automatic digital computer It was a binary 22 it floating point calculator The Z3 had loops but no conditional jumps the memory and calculation units were based on telephone relays The First Electronic Computer Inventor Tommy Flowers Image Credit Wikimedia Commons If you believe computers inherently need to be electronic then British telephone engineer Tommy Flowers can make a strong claim to have invented the first computer Flowers designed and built Colossus It was used by the British to decipher encrypted messages between the German High Command during World War II The computer could perform Boolean and counting operations using thermionic valves It was the world squo  first programmable electronic digital computer But Colossus was still programmed with switches and plugs rather than stored programs if you wanted to change a computer squo  program you had to undertake a lengthy rewiring and restructuring process The Manchester Baby Image Credit Wikimedia Commons The world squo  first electronic stored rogram computer was the Small cale Experimental Machine  SEM mdash icknamed the Manchester Baby It was created by Frederic Williams Tom Kilburn and Geoff Tootill at the Victoria University of Manchester England The Manchester Baby ran for the first time in on 21 June 1948 Oddly the machine was never intended to be a practical usable computer Instead it was a test bed for the world squo  first RAM Williams Kilburn Tootill quickly went about refining the SSEM into the Manchester Mark I  949  By 1951 the Mark I had evolved into the Manchester Electronic Computer  erranti Mark 1 mdash he world squo  first commercially available general urpose computer The Modern Contenders John Blankenbaker Xerox and IBM Of course the Manchester Electronic Computer was still a long way from the machines we use today But by the mid 950s the pace of development was growing exponentially The rate of development is one of the many reasons why you shouldn squo  bother future roofing your computer  1953 IBM unveils the 701 the world squo  first scientific computer 1955 MIT launches Whirlwind the first computer with integrated RAM 1956 MIT demos the first transistorized computer 1964 Italian Pier Giorgio Perotto unveils the Programma 101 the first desktop machine 44 00 were sold 1968 Hewlett Packard started selling the HP 9100A It was the first mass arketed desktop computer And so to the 1970s American John Blankenbaker created what many experts consider to be the first personal computer dash he Kenbak  The computer went on sale in 1971 just 50 machines were built They sold for  50 that squo  about   00 today But even the Kenbak  was a far cry from today squo  machines It used a series of switches and lights for inputting data Image Credit Wikimedia Commons The first computer that resembled a modern machine was the Xerox Alto  974  It had a display GUI and mouse Apps opened in windows and icons and menus were commonplace across the operating system The Xerox Alto never went on general sale but about 500 were used in universities around the world Steve Jobs received a demo of the Alto in 1979 the concepts it used formed the basis of the Apple Lisa and Macintosh systems Finally in August 1981 IBM released its Personal Computer The open architecture machine was instantly popular giving rise to a host of compatible programs and peripherals Within a year of its release there were 753 software packages available more than four times as many as on the Apple Macintosh a year after its release Who Invented the Computer There are other contenders that we squo e not touched on There squo  Blaise Pascal who invented the mechanical calculator in 1642 and Ismail al azari  136 206  whose castle clock is considered to be the earliest programmable analog computer And what about Alan Turing He theorized the Turing machine in 1936 and designed the Automatic Computing Engine  CE in the post ar years So who deserves the crown We can squo  decide but make sure you let us know what you think in the comments And what about the future Will computers take over the world Well there are definitely some jobs that computers can never do 6 Human Jobs That Computers Will

don  get why we have to have various definitions of a simple man made device To this day the human brain is still a complex biological phenomena yet we have a simple name and definition for it one which all countries in the world agree to However we e still arguing on the definition and inventor of a computer Reply Sam C March 15 2019 at 10 1 am If you believe in a higher being then God created the first computer called the Brain If not then nature created the first computer called the Brain My first computer was the Commodore 64 Reply Ricardo Leon March 14 2019 at 6 7 pm In this article you are talking about the PERSONAL computer not mainframes ike the IBM 1401 1620 360 and the like Reply Peter Shaw March 13 2019 at 9 1 am A notable exception usually unknown to American audiences is the LEO  yons Electronic Office which was the first computer used for commercial business applications Leo III was my training ground It has an interesting history and they ran from 1954 to 1981 initially valve and later transistor machines There are lots of Google references and some videos Reply Rick Pike March 12 2019 at 4 7 pm How about the Atanasoff computer from Iowa State in the 1930s Reply Adrian Zeffert March 8 2019 at 4 7 pm Hi all There are several pieces of history missing from the article The article was very interesting but Alan Turing provided practical  lectrical computing to deciphering the Enigma codes in 1943 or so In 1962 I was at the British bureau of Standards in Teddington and saw one of the first practical computations for hydro plane ng A car doing 120 mph on the then first section of the new M1 Motorway crashed after it became airborne The computer was in a very large room full if racks of Octal valve  ube flip lops The main control panel had dozens of tube amplifiers and a digital voltmeter I was there to service the digital voltmeter and trade out some amplifiers Next the Timex inclair 1000 the Apple 2 the National Semiconductor 4 bit processors and many others which came along between 1947 and 1982 In 1966 I was attending Newark College Of Engineering now NJIT Back then our main computer was an RCA Spectra 70 It filled a very large airconditiond room a bvb d could batch process Holerith cards cards coded with Fortran IV equations So I believe that your arrival should be corrected to include the early kit computers Cray 1 etc Reply dragonmouth March 7 2019 at 12 7 pm Where in this history does ENIAC fit Becoming operational in December of 1945 it pre ates both  he Manchester Baby and  he Modern Contenders  Reply Dan Price March 7 2019 at 5 4 pm Yeah it slots between Colossus and the Manchester Baby I didn  include it as it wasn  the  irst for anything there were already electronic computers and it wasn  a stored program machine An important piece of kit though no doubt Reply Dan Price 1354 articles Dan is a British expat living in Mexico He is the Managing Editor for MUO  sister ite Blocks Decoded At various times he has been
