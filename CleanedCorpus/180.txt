the apple company start  we also give you interesting and not well nown tidbits and facts about the company and its legendary founders So sit back and let's take a stroll down memory lane It All Started Here The history of Apple is nothing short of a fairytale Apple the tech behemoth had humble beginnings The company was initially started in a garage and by three friends who had big dreams The Apple Company history starts from the friendship of two Steves – the world famous Steve Jobs and his buddy Steve Wozniak Answering the question Who is the founder of the Apple company  Very often people forget that there was a third person involved apart from the two Steves mentioned above Jobs brought Wayne into the company to provide business advice to him and Wozniak But Wayne backed out of the venture even before Apple could officially be incorporated He took an  00 check for his shares and quit Today four decades later his shares would have been worth  2 billion Talk of missed opportunities Jobs and Wozniak were real close Their ardent passion for technology and the ability to think ahead and their mutual love for pranks made them lifelong friends The two friends were constantly using their technical know ow to impress and have fun Here are some of their notorious pranks from their youth The duo rigged up a painting of a hand which displayed the middle finger right during a solemn graduation ceremony at Jobs' school Another prank involved them nearly getting access to the Pope at the Vatican via a long istance call Jobs and Wozniak were also working on building"blue boxes  a technology that made long istance calls for free The Beginning of Apple – The First Apple Computer Both Jobs and Woz belonged to the Homebrew Computer Club a computer hobbyist group It was here that Woz came across the MITS' Altair from which he drew inspiration While Woz was impressed by the DIY approach of the Altair he wanted something simpler and easy to use This philosophy is reflected in Apple's products even today Woz built the first modern ay computer that had a typewriter ike keyboard and for the output it was connected to a regular TV screen This invention later came to be known as the Apple I the template for all modern day computers Woz in an interview he gave to the NPR in 2006 stated that while working on the Apple I he wasn't concerned about building the prototype for all modern ay computers Instead he wanted to impress his peers by creating an inexpensive computer When was Apple Founded The Official Start Date When Jobs saw Woz's invention he recognized its brilliance and its immense potential He then sold his VW microbus and Woz parted with his HP calculator  alculators cost a pretty penny back in those days and they together along with Wayne officially started Apple Computer Inc on 1 st April 1976 The rest as they say is history The Early Years Jobs and Wozniak along with Mike Markkula  ho was one of the earliest employees of Apple Inc designed and sold a series of computers in the late 1970s This was the first line of commercially successful personal computers and was named as Apple II Following the success of Apple II Apple Inc released the Apple Lisa in the year 1983 The Lisa was the first computer that came with a mouse The mouse was used to perform commands on a GUI  raphical User Interface  Following the Lisa the Apple Macintosh was released in 1984 The launch of Apple Mac was announced with an ad that is still considered today as one of the greatest ads of all time From here the Apple legend began to grow exponentially The Fall and Rise of the Apple Legend – Steve Jobs In the year 1985 Steve Jobs had a huge blowout with the board of Apple Inc As a result Jobs had to leave the company he helped to create At that time people considered this as a Steve Jobs failure  But then he would prove them all wrong If you are to learn only one thing from the life of Steve Jobs then remember this – there's nothing such as the failure story  Failures are nothing but temporary obstacles for you to overcome before you can reach the peaks of success Jobs went on to found a tech company NeXT that focused on higher education and business Later in 1986 Jobs began to develop a major interest in a small division of the popular Lucasfilm Ltd Jobs acquired the company that was involved in the development of Computer Generated Graphics for films This was indeed a genius stroke of Jobs The company later came to be known as Pixar acknowledged worldwide as the greatest movie aking studios of all time After several projects plenty of trial and error Pixar studios released Toy Story in 1995 with Jobs as the creative producer of the animated film The rest is history and Jobs bounced back into the limelight In 1996 Apple Inc bought NeXT and asked Jobs to come back to Apple in a leadership role Jobs was appointed as the interim CEO of Apple Inc from 1997 to 2000 Later he became the permanent CEO of the firm till he resigned in 2011 World Domination both by Apple and Jobs At the time when Jobs came back to Apple in 1996 Microsoft was the leader in the market for personal computers and Apple was considered a niche platform The higher priced Apple PCs were used only by people in the creative industries like motion pictures design and advertising Jobs changed all that with the introduction of the Apple iPod in 2001 Suddenly the whole world began looking up at Apple with reverence and admiration Jobs completely transformed the way music was listened and shared Soon Apple products were the most sought fter in the market Everyone couldn't wait to own an Apple product It became a status symbol The iPhone was released in 2007 and Apple sealed its position as the world dominator in technology It was a major victory for Jobs and he was crowned the undisputed genius of the"tech world  In 2010 Apple released the first ver iPad While it received lukewarm reception initially Jobs went ahead and focused on it By the year 2011 more than 15 million iPads were sold all over the world The Twist in the Tale – Jobs Fights with Cancer There were plenty of rumors since 2006 about the health of Jobs His frail appearance lackluster speeches were highly criticized In reality Jobs announced his deteriorating health condition to his team in mid 004 He was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer Between the years 2003 and his death in August 2011 Jobs underwent several therapies and surgeries to beat cancer But the procedures were futile as his cancer had reached advanced stages He stepped down from his post as the CEO of Apple Inc on 24 th August 2011 Jobs succumbed to cancer just a few weeks later and passed away on 11 th September 2011 The world lost a genius Apple After Jobs To say Apple Inc misses its charismatic and genius founder would be the understatement of the century Yes Jobs had a negative side – huge ego no feelings for people not worried about costs and a major perfectionist But that doesn't detract him in any way There's no denying the fact that Jobs was an incredible visionary and a brilliant marketer who charted entire pages in history by himself New products from Apple have met with mediocre reception And everything from the house of Apple after Jobs still relies on the vision of Jobs to succeed The Future of Apple To put it frankly it's a mixed bag Yes even today Apple iPhones are sold at premium prices and there are plenty of takers for it Yet Apple seems to have lost its charm a little bit Will Apple beat its own record by introducing a revolutionary product like the Apple Mac iPod iPhone or iPad Only time will tell Before we wrap up this post here are some important facts about Apple Inc that will

facts about Apple and its genius founder so that you can appreciate the company a bit more There has been much debate about the name of the company But the real reason is quite simple Jobs like the

its"Easter eggs" in movies Apple had a hidden Easter egg in the first version of the iPod To activate the Easter egg users had to go to the about menu and hold the home button for a few seconds Doing so activated a game called"Breakout  This game was initially created by Jobs and Wozniak during their time at Atari The Apple I was sold for a price of  66 No neither Jobs nor Wozniak belonged to any evil satanic cult Rather Woz saw that the price was  67 and since he likes repeating numbers changed the retail price to  66 Apple creates fake projects for its senior employees to work on If any
