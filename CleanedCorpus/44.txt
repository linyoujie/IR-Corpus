Troubling History of the Fight to Honor Leif Erikson—Not Columbus—as the Man Who  iscovered America The Viking ship that sailed from Norway to the World  Columbian Exposition  orld  Fair in 1893 Museum of Science and Industry Chicago—Getty Images By Olivia B Waxman Updated October 4 2019 2 4 PM ET  Originally published October 5 2018 3 8 PM EDT Many Americans will celebrate the second Monday in October as Columbus Day a federal holiday that marks the anniversary of Christopher Columbus 8217  Spanish ed expedition arriving in the Americas or as Indigenous Peoples Day  to acknowledge those who were displaced by European settlement in North America Others however will opt for Oct 9 to celebrate something else Leif Erikson Day a celebration of the Viking explorer credited with reaching the continent around the year 1000 nearly 500 years before Columbus did But while it may sound only fair to share the credit for exploration the movement to recognize Erikson also has a dark back story as Leif Erikson Day 8217  history is connected to nativist backlash against immigration to the United States At one point for some people the debate over who really  8220 iscovered 8221 America came down to one question who was whiter The biggest ship carrying Norwegian immigrants to the U  arrived in 1825 and many of its passengers went to the Midwest in search of the peace and quiet of the countryside Their homeland had become more crowded during a population boom that the country 8217  economy struggled to keep pace with according to J slash n Br slash dal professor and Chair of the Center for American Studies at the University of Southern Denmark Signs of Scandinavian merican identity such as an increase in English anguage translations of the Norse sagas began to grow But interest in that history really spiked after the publication of the provocatively titled 1874 book America Not Discovered By Columbus by Rasmus B Anderson the founder of the Scandinavian studies program at the University of Wisconsin Anderson 8217  account detailed  8220 he first expedition to New England 8221 in the year 1000 and described Leif Erikson as  8220 he first pale aced man 8221 and  8220 irst white man who turned the bow of his ship towards the west for the purpose of finding America  221 He claimed American democracy descended from Norsemen 8217  system of government of  8220 ree people 8221 whose  8220 ulers were elected by the people in convention assembled  221 Furthermore he made a case that Americans whose ancestors came from the U  actually had Viking blood too due to earlier Norse invasions of Britain Anderson also claimed that Leif Erikson 8217  brother Thorvald was slaughtered by the indigenous people and buried with two crosses and that his  8220 keleton in armor 8221 was later uncovered in Massachusetts He ginned up this story to make it seem as if the Vikings had been the victims of Native American violence argues JoAnne Mancini author of the 2002 journal article  8220 iscovering Viking America  221 This alternate discovery narrative could serve as  8220  salve to Americans 8217 and particularly New Englanders 8217 increasingly guilty conscience about the treatment of Native Americans  8221 in the late 19th century and a way for  8220 candinavian newcomers to the West 8221 to feel better about their own personal  8220 omplicity in the brutal conquest of Indian lands   221 Related Stories Newsfeed 104 ear ld WWII Veteran Is Asking People to Send Him Valentines Newsfeed Don Lemon Tipsy and Tattooed Won New Year's Eve on Twitter

drive for a Leif Erikson Day during that period was also part of a wave of concern among many Americans over an influx of southern and eastern European immigrants who were not considered fully white  dash a group that included Italians Catholics were also mistrusted by many which left Columbus with two strikes against him In fact Marie Brown author of a book called The Icelandic Discoverers of America O r Honour to Whom Honour Is Due testified in a 1887 U  Senate hearing that honoring Christopher Columbus  8220 ould be to publicly sanction the claims of the Church of Rome to this land and virtually to invite the pope to come and take possession of it  221  ne irony of that belief Mancini has pointed out is that there were Vikings who followed the Church of Rome too  Some of Columbus 8217 defenders at the time tried to push back by pointing out that he was from Genoa in northern Italy where many residents have boasted Nordic roots so  8220 e could be  8216 orgiven 8217 for being Italian  221 according to Br slash dal Spotlight Story A Year After Christchurch Jacinda Ardern Has the World  Attention How Will She Use It The New Zealand prime minister earned international acclaim for her leadership in the face of tragedy Now she has to persuade her country to keep the faith For some Scandinavian immigrants the Leif Erikson and Viking history wareness campaigns were an effort to solidify their group 8217  place at the top of the  8220 thnoracial hierarchies in the U   8221 adds Br slash dal  8220 here was a recognition of the Scandinavians having somehow behaved well in the U   being viewed as people good at assimilating so that allowed for these kinds of celebrations  221 Wisconsin is considered the first U  State to recognize Leif Erikson Day in 1929 For a while the choice of which explorer to applaud was a controversial political issue  but eventually boosters for both decided they could live in harmony As the vice president of the Minnesota Leif Erikson Monument Association said in 1934  8220 here is ample room for honoring both of these men  221 In fact during Franklin Delano Roosevelt 8217  presidency Columbus Day became a federal holiday in 1937  and he issued a statement in Sep 1940 suggesting Americans read up on Leif Erikson on Oct 9 By 1956 seven states mostly in the Midwest hosted some sort observance for the explorer So why hasn 8217  Leif Erikson Day become as universally known as Columbus Day There isn 8217  one straightforward answer Mancini has argued the debate over shades of whiteness fizzled out once the quota system that restricted immigration in the  8217 0s was replaced To Br slash dal the facts speak for themselves and Columbus gets more credit because he simply did more to cultivate transatlantic trade routes And then there 8217  the issue of available evidence to support the story of Leif Erikson While translations of sagas telling the Leif Erikson story have long been readily available finding hard evidence was more difficult When Anderson was writing his book the translations of the sagas weren 8217  clear about even the basics of the location of  8220 inland  221 where Leif Erikson and his fleet landed leading many New England elites to guess he landed in Boston or Philadelphia  8220 his is imagined purely imagined  221 says Adam Miyashiro a medieval literature professor at Stockton University and expert on race in the Middle Ages In the 1950s a map known as the  8220 inland Map 8221 was discovered in a medieval book that came into the hands of a private collector and scholars decided it was from 1440 and was the first known map to show the Western Hemisphere before Columbus got there  8220 he map throws further doubt on the legend that Columbus was sailing into completely mysterious and uncharted seas when he set out with his small fleet in 1492 Instead it appears possible that the Viking voyages may have served as an incentive to Columbus and Cabot and other rediscoverers of America in the 15th century  221 TIME noted when it went on display in 1965   220 n a wall in East Boston one embittered Italian merican scrawled  216 eif Ericsson is a fink 8217  230  221 the magazine

Norse penny minted between 1065 and 1080 and found in 1957 at an Indian site near Brooklin Maine nearly all of  he supposed Viking artifacts have turned out to be bogus  221 TIME noted in a 2000 story

modern forgery So is Yale 8217  Vinland Map a seemingly antique chart with the marking  8216 inilanda Insula 8217 that surfaced in the 1950s bound into a medieval book  221 The most significant archaeological excavation related to the origins of Leif Erikson 8217  trip took place in 1960 when archaeologists revealed that Erikson had first landed in Newfoundland Canada not in what 8217  now the U   8220 n retrospect it is astonishing that the evidence took so long to be found That year Norwegian explorer Helge Ingstad and his wife archaeologist Anne Stine Ingstad went to Newfoundland to explore a place identified on an Icelandic map from the 1670s as  8216 romontorium Winlandiae  217 near the small fishing village of L 8217 nse aux Meadows in the province 8217  northern reaches They were certain that it marked the location of an ancient Norse settlement  221 TIME explained in that 2000 story  8220 inding the settlement turned out to be absurdly easy When the Ingstads asked the locals if there were any odd ruins in the area they were taken to a place known as  8216 he Indian camp  217 They immediately recognized the grass overed ridges as Viking ra ruins like those in Iceland and Greenland  221 But even though Erikson arrived in Canada instead of the U   that hasn 8217  stopped some Americans from celebrating his achievement Since at least FDR American presidents have generally issued annual proclamations recognizing Oct 9 as a day to honor Leif Erikson 8217  achievements and more currently the achievements of the larger Scandinavian merican community At least for Br slash dal it 8217  hard to imagine the holiday will gain much more additional recognition at this point especially as the tide grows behind the idea of Indigenous Peoples Day since the celebration of the Viking explorer isn 8217  any less problematic in that sense than the celebration of the Italian explorer And yet both holidays have become a source of pride for Italian mericans and Scandinavian mericans and have become opportunities for these groups to raise awareness about their roles in the American story  8220 nlike Columbus the Vikings may not have established a permanent presence in North America the first time around  221 TIME observed in 2000  8220 ut given the millions of Americans who share at least a bit of Viking blood they are still there  dash and in
