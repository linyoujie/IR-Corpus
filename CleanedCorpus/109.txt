U  states now have broad legislation in place that allows the use of marijuana in some form Think of the states as dominoes lined up one by one When the first domino topples it leads to a chain reaction that causes most if not all of the others to fall That  what has happened and continues to happen with state legalization of marijuana The timeline for marijuana legalization in the U  shows how those dominoes keep falling Image source Getty Images Decriminalization vs legalization Let  first differentiate two actions states have taken with respect to marijuana Decriminalization refers to the relaxation of criminal penalties associated with personal marijuana use Oregon was the first state to decriminalize marijuana in 1973 The state imposed just a  00 fine for possession of up to an ounce Over the next 15 years following Oregon  legal change at least a dozen other states decriminalized marijuana But decriminalization merely lowered or removed the sting from antimarijuana laws Manufacturing and selling marijuana remained illegal Legalization on the other hand not only allows individual marijuana possession but in most cases it also permits the legal production and sale of the drug There are two types of marijuana legalization the legalization of medical cannabis and the legalization of recreational marijuana All but four U  states have some form of medical marijuana law However 13 states only allow the legal use of cannabidiol  BD or medical cannabis that has a low tetrahydrocannabinol  HC content CBD is a chemical ingredient of the cannabis plant that isn  psychoactive while THC is the primary psychoactive ingredient in cannabis These 13 states usually aren  included in the number of states that have legalized medical marijuana because their laws place strict limitations on the form and manner of medical marijuana use Thirty hree states however allow patients broad access to marijuana for medical purposes Eleven states plus the District of Columbia have cannabis laws in place that allow the legal use of marijuana for both medical and recreational purposes No prescription is required for individuals to use marijuana in these jurisdictions Some of the laws regulating marijuana are quite unusual  however For example the District of Columbia allows the legal use of recreational marijuana but technically still bans the buying and selling of the drug Key marijuana legalization milestones While the decriminalization of marijuana in the U  began in 1973 it wasn  until 1996 that the march toward legalization began Here are the key milestones for

approves Marijuana Opportunity Reinvestment and Expungement Act  ORE Act of 2019  which would decriminalize marijuana at the federal level in the U  Data sources National Conference of State Legislatures CNN Congress ov Most important laws passed There has been quite a lot of activity in recent years to promote the legal use of marijuana for either medical or recreational purposes Five of these laws especially stand out because of their significant impact California  Proposition 215  996  With this ballot initiative California became the first state to legalize medical marijuana California was the first domino to fall and gave organizers outside the state the confidence to push for the legalization of medical marijuana in their states Colorado  Amendment 64  012  Colorado became one of the first two states to legalize recreational marijuana through a ballot initiative The state also set the standard for others in how to regulate recreational marijuana Washington  Initiative 502  012  Washington state residents voted to legalize recreational marijuana at the same time Colorado did California  Proposition 64  016  California  passage of a ballot initiative to legalize recreational marijuana is important because of the state  size The legal marijuana market in California was more than   billion in 2019 nearly twice the size of Colorado  total marijuana market  Vermont  H 511  018  Tiny Vermont deserves distinction as the first state to legalize recreational marijuana by way of the state legislature rather than through a ballot initiative However there was a twist with Vermont  law While the use of recreational marijuana up to an ounce is allowed the sale of recreational marijuana is still illegal for now Significant proponents and opponents As you might expect the legalization of marijuana has attracted both vocal supporters and opponents Several groups have formed on both sides of the question Here are some of the most influential of these groups Proponents National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws Founded in 1970 NORML is probably the most influential marijuana advocacy group The organization championed early marijuana decriminalization efforts and remains active in working to legalize both medical and recreational marijuana across the nation NORML  advisory board includes quite a few celebrities  including comedian Bill Maher actor Woody Harrelson actor Tommy Chong and singer Willie Nelson Marijuana Policy Project Founded in 1995 MPP lobbies the U  Congress and state legislatures with a special focus on decriminalizing marijuana and changing laws to make medical marijuana available to patients The organization was active publicly and behind the scenes on many of the marijuana legalization milestones mentioned earlier Drug Policy Alliance DPA  roots date to 1987 when American University professor Arnold Trebach and attorney Kevin Zeese who had previously worked with NORML founded the Drug Policy Foundation  PF  In 2000 DPF merged with The Lindesmith Center another organization focused on changing U  drug policy and adopted its current name The organization has been front and center in several victories including the legalization of recreational marijuana in California and Colorado Opponents Smart Approaches to Marijuana  AM  On the other side of the fence are several prominent organizations opposing marijuana legalization Former Obama administration drug policy advisor Kevin Sabet and former Rep Patrick Kennedy      started SAM one of the top antimarijuana groups in 2013 SAM  primary focus is to prevent a  ig marijuana equivalent to the  ig tobacco group of large tobacco makers that exert significant influence nationally Drug Free America Foundation Former U  ambassador to Italy Mel Sembler and his wife Betty started DFAF in 1976 DFAF promotes national and state policies to reduce drug use and addiction Others Some companies have also fought against marijuana legalization Insys Therapeutics  NASDAQ NSY  donated  00 00 in 2016 to help defeat a ballot initiative to legalize recreational marijuana in Arizona Not so coincidentally Insys markets a cannabinoid drug Syndros which launched in 2017 for treating anorexia in people with AIDS and for treating chemotherapy nduced nausea and vomiting Barriers to legalization Despite the number of states that have legalized marijuana the drug remains illegal at the federal level Marijuana is a controlled substance under federal law and the U  Supreme Court has ruled that the federal government can prosecute violations of applicable federal laws even in states that have legalized marijuana Nevertheless 33 states have elected to legalize marijuana despite federal laws to the contrary Why haven  the other states moved forward with legalization The biggest reason is probably concern about the potential for abuse of marijuana and the societal problems to which this abuse might contribute It didn  help that a 2017 report from the National Academies of Science Engineering and Medicine stated that  onclusive evidence regarding the short and long erm health effects   both harms and benefits   of cannabis use remains elusive  Marijuana opponents use this report to question the wisdom of legalizing a product for which uncertainties regarding safety exist These concerns are a major factor holding back states from legalizing recreational marijuana Many Americans continue to oppose any use of narcotic drugs for recreational purposes Even among those who do support legalization of marijuana it  often not a top priority These factors make it easy for some politicians to oppose legalization or simply ignore the topic Ironically the legalization of hemp in the U  in December 2018 also presents a hurdle for similar legalization of marijuana  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell   Ky  championed the legalization of hemp because of the thriving hemp industry in his home state of Kentucky The legalization of marijuana would pave the way for more competition for hemp businesses in Kentucky It  unlikely therefore that Sen McConnell will support any attempt to vote on marijuana legalization in the U  Senate Since the Senate majority leader decides which measures come before the full Senate for a vote Sen McConnell can effectively single andedly prevent marijuana legalization in the U  The future of U  marijuana legalization It seems likely that more states will legalize marijuana Several states could vote on legalizing either medical or recreational marijuana in 2020  It  also possible that some of the states that have highly restrictive medical marijuana laws could relax those laws to allow broader access One big factor driving this trend is that states need additional revenue  Just as most states legalized lotteries to generate revenue many states could consider legalizing marijuana as a way to boost their revenue without making unpopular moves such as raising income or sales taxes Could U  federal laws be changed to ease restrictions against the use and sale of marijuana It  not out of the question Public support among Americans for legalizing marijuana is at an all ime high  and Americans support the rights of states to make and enforce their own marijuana laws However a majority of older U  citizens who traditionally vote in high numbers still oppose legalization Most Americans indicate that they would vote for a candidate with whom they disagreed on marijuana policy Senators and representatives who want to play it safe could remain opposed to federal legalization of marijuana Implications for investors Marijuana is already a large industry with U  sales in 2019 estimated to be more than  2 billion By 2022 U  marijuana sales could top  2 billion  Marijuana investors won  find too many industries that could nearly double in three years A big challenge though is that there are few really good marijuana investing alternatives among U  stocks Most of the ones available are relatively small and trade over the counter rather than on major stock exchanges They also tend to sport astronomical valuations There are exceptions though Innovative Industrial Properties  NYSE IPR  provides real estate capital to medical cannabis operators buying properties and leasing them to customers Scotts Miracle ro  NYSE MG  is the go o supplier of hydroponics products for marijuana growers Both companies are profitable  Their valuations aren  outrageous And both companies even pay dividends The fortunes of both Innovative Industrial Properties and Scotts Miracle ro as well as other U  marijuana stocks  will be greatly affected by what happens with marijuana legalization in the United States If more states legalize marijuana and r the federal government relaxes its cannabis laws these stocks could soar But as long as the threat exists that the feds could crack down on the marijuana industry buying these stocks will come with an added level of risk Marijuana investors should proceed cautiously  Motley Fool Returns Stock Advisor S  500 365 87 Stock Advisor launched in
