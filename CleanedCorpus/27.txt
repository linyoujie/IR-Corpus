to study the nature of lunar dust and the effects of pressure on the surface during the historic first manned moon landing in July 1969  mage © NASA The historic launch of the Apollo 11 mission carried three astronauts toward the moon Two of them would set foot on the lunar surface for the first time in human history as millions of people around the world followed their steps on television The astronauts The crew of Apollo 11 were all experienced astronauts who had been to space before Cmdr  Neil Armstrong had piloted Gemini 8 that mission was the first time two vehicles docked in space Born Aug 5 1930 in Ohio Armstrong was 38 when he became the first civilian to command two American space missions Col Edwin Eugene   uzz Aldrin  39 was the first astronaut with a doctorate to fly in space Born Jan 20 1930 in New Jersey Aldrin piloted Gemini 12 in November 1966 and performed a 140 inute walk in space to demonstrate that an astronaut could work efficiently outside the vehicle For Apollo 11 he served as the lunar module pilot The command module pilot Lt Col Michael Collins 38 was born in Italy on Oct 31 1930 Collins piloted Gemini 10 in July 1966 and spent almost 1  hours outside the craft on a spacewalk  Apollo 11 crew Neil Armstrong Michael Collins and Edwin  uzz Aldrin  mage credit NASA From Earth to the moon Mission planners at NASA studied the lunar surface for two years searching for the best place to make the historic landing They examined the best high esolution photographs available at the time from the Lunar Orbiter and Surveyor programs and considered the number of craters and boulders cliffs and hills at each prospective landing site and how easy it would be for the astronauts to land given their fuel and time requirements This helped the planners narrow down the initial 30 site candidates to three Apollo 11 launched from Kennedy Space Center in Florida at 9 2 a  Eastern time on July 16 1969 While in flight the crew made two televised broadcasts from the interior of the ship and a third transmission as they drew closer to the moon revealing the lunar surface and the intended approach path On July 20 Armstrong and Aldrin entered the lunar module nicknamed the  agle and separated from the  Command Service Module   dash the  olumbia  dash and headed toward the lunar surface The lunar module touched down on the moon   Sea of Tranquility  a large basaltic region at 4 7 p  Eastern time Armstrong notified Houston with the historic words  ouston Tranquility Base here The Eagle has landed   For the first 2 hours on the moon Armstrong and Aldrin remained in the module and checked all of the systems configured the craft for its stay on the moon and had a bite to eat In consultation with NASA they decided to skip their scheduled 4 our rest and opted to go outside and explore the moon  surface instead A video camera installed in a panel inside the Eagle provided live coverage as Armstrong descended a ladder at 11 6 p  on July 20 1969 and uttered the words  hat  one small step for man one giant leap for mankind   Aldrin followed 20 minutes later with Armstrong taking images of his descent Armstrong had the responsibility to document the landing so most of the images taken from the Apollo 11 mission were of Aldrin  NASA  Historic Apollo 11 Moon Landing in Pictures  Apollo 11 astronaut Buzz Aldrin poses

erected a United States flag and took core samples from the crust They spoke with U  President Richard Nixon whose voice was transmitted from the White House and placed a plaque on the ground that stated HERE MEN FROM THE PLANET EARTH FIRST SET FOOT UPON THE MOON JULY 1969 A  WE CAME IN PEACE FOR ALL MANKIND The astronauts also laid down memorial medallions with the names of several astronauts and cosmonauts who had perished in flight and in training  ncluding the Apollo 11 crew and the first person in space Yuri Gagarin   They also left a 1  nch silicon disk with goodwill messages from 73 countries and the names of congressional and NASA leaders Armstrong spent a little over 2  hours outside the Eagle The astronauts traveled a total distance of about 3 00 feet   kilometer as they walked around traveling as far as 200 feet  0 meters from the module to visit a large crater They collected 47 1 lbs  1 5 kilograms of samples from the moon and reported that mobility on the moon was

Collins waited in the Columbia The two vehicles docked and the crew and samples transferred to the Columbia before the Eagle was jettisoned into space The astronauts then headed back home The team splashed down in the Pacific Ocean at 12 0 p  Eastern time on July 24 only a few miles from the recovery ship the U   Hornet After donning biological isolation garments  n the off hance that the astronauts carried back any harmful microbes from the moon  the crew left the Columbia and climbed into a rubber boat where they were rubbed down with iodine in an effort to minimize potential contamination They then traveled by helicopter to a Mobile Quarantine Facility aboard the ship before being taken to Houston where they remained in quarantine until Aug 10 The men had completed the national goal set by President John F Kennedy in 1961 to perform a crewed lunar landing and return to Earth Apollo 11  legacy The Apollo 11 mission remains widely celebrated as it approaches its 50th anniversary in 2019 The U  Mint  prepared special coins for the celebration   The Smithsonian Institution is remodeling its moon gallery at the National Air and Space Museum  ASM in Washington D   for a 2021 opening Meanwhile the  newly restored Columbia spacecraft is on tour  with stops in Houston St Louis Pittsburgh and Seattle It  the first time Columbia has been outside the Smithsonian since 1971 In July 2009 the National Air and Space Museum hosted a gala for Apollo 11  40th anniversary  which included speeches by the three crewmembers of Apollo 11 At an afternoon session in which Collins Aldrin and Apollo 12 astronaut Alan Bean offered to sign autographs the line of space enthusiasts and admirers quickly stretched across the length of the museum  floor Collins and Aldrin still regularly make appearances for Apollo elated activities despite both being in their late 80s Armstrong 82 died on Aug 25 2012 from complications following cardiovascular procedures A  public memorial service was held Sept 13 at Washington National Cathedral  and Armstrong was  buried at sea the next day  In 2015 NASA announced that Armstrong  widow arol Armstrong had found a  bag full of lunar artifacts  among Armstrong  belongings which she donated to the museum Apollo 11 astronauts still in their quarantine van are greeted by their wives upon arrival at Ellington Air Force Base on July 27 1969  mage credit NASA NASA  Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter  imaged the Apollo 11 landing site from space  in 2012 and spotted the astronauts tracks some of the experiments a discarded camera and the descent stage of the Eagle lunar module A  3D view of the site  based on the images from the orbiter was generated in 2014 A lunar sample bag from Apollo 11 generated a legal dispute after it was accidentally sold at a Texas auction in 2015 held on behalf of the U  Marshals Service An Illinois woman Nancy Carlson bought the bag for  95 The U  government petitioned the courts to return the lunar sample bag to NASA and undo the sale but  Carlson was ruled the legal owner in 2016  Originally the bag was confiscated from Max Ary a former curator convicted in 2006 of stealing and selling space artifacts that belonged to the Cosmosphere space museum in Hutchinson Kansas In anticipation of Apollo 11  50th anniversary in July 2019 Universal Pictures released  irst Man  a movie based on Armstrong  training journey to become the first man on the moon And a new documentary about Apollo 11 directed by Todd Douglas Miller premiered in March 2019 Additionally the National Air and Space
