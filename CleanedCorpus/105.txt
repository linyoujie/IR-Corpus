1969 1st footsteps on moon Posted by Deborah Byrd in Human World  Space  July 20 2019 This week is the 50th anniversary of humanity 8217  historic first steps on the moon The story in pictures here   The world watched on television as Neil Armstrong took the first steps on the moon 8217  surface on July 20 1969 It was the first time humans walked another world As he stepped onto the lunar surface Armstrong said  8220 hat is one small step for   man one giant leap for mankind  221 July 20 1969 On this date Apollo 11 astronauts Buzz Aldrin and Neil Armstrong landed their moon module on a broad dark lunar lava flow called the Sea of Tranquility Six hours later Neil Armstrong became the first human being to walk on the surface of a world beyond Earth Armstrong and Aldrin spent 21 1  hours on the moon 8217  surface They collected 47  pounds  1  kg of moon rocks for return to Earth Then they blasted off in their module from the lunar surface to meet up with Michael Collins in the command module orbiting overhead They returned safely to Earth and landed in the Pacific Ocean on July 24 1969 Apollo 11 launch at 13 2 0 UTC   2 0 a  EDT local time on July 16 1969 Astronauts Neil A Armstrong Michael Collins and Edwin E  8220 uzz 8221 Aldrin Jr  were aboard Apollo 11 left Earth via a type of rocket now no longer used called a Saturn V The giant Saturn V rocket was 111 meters  63 feet tall about the height of a 36 tory all building Read more about the Saturn V rocket The Apollo command module 8217  position atop the Saturn V at launch The lunar module  8211 the craft that descended to the moon 8217  surface  8211 is positioned just below the command module in this diagram Apollo 11 orbited Earth 1 1  times Twelve minutes after launch it separated from the Saturn V as a propulsion maneuver sent it on a path toward the moon Here is a view of Earth from Apollo 11 shortly after it left Earth orbit Happy Apollo 11 mission officials in the Launch Control Center following

camera during the third broadcast from space on the way to the moon Earth seen by Apollo 11 astronauts on their way to the moon Here is the Apollo 11 lunar module  8211 the vehicle that would carry Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin to the moon 8217  surface It was called  8220 agle  221 This photo shows the module in a landing configuration photographed in lunar orbit from the command module which was called  8220 olumbia  221 Astronaut Michael Collins alone aboard Columbia inspected Eagle as it pirouetted before him to ensure the craft was not damaged The Eagle lunar module captured this image of the Columbia command module in lunar orbit Columbia stayed in lunar orbit with Michael Collins aboard during Eagle 8217  descent and landing In the video below you can hear the excitement in Armstrong 8217  voice at the successful landing of Eagle on the moon 8217  surface as he says Tranquility Base here The Eagle has landed An early concern of space engineers had been that the lunar regolith  the fine soil covering the moon would be soft like quicksand There was some fear that the Eagle lunar module would sink after landing Hence Armstrong 8217  comment about the depth of the footpads in the lunar soil as he descended the ladder before stepping onto the moon Buzz Aldrin descends the steps of the lunar module ladder as he becomes the second human being to walk on the moon Armstrong and Aldrin at work on the moon They deployed a U  flag and several science experiments and collected moon rocks Here is Buzz Aldrin who piloted the lunar module Eagle to the moon 8217  surface with the LR  a reflecting array designed to bounce laser beams fired from Earth back to Earth This experiment which helped refine our knowledge of the moon 8217  distance and the shape of its orbit around Earth is still returning data from the moon The Apollo astronauts brought the first moon rocks back to Earth Here is sample number 10046 The lunar module Eagle on the surface of the moon Neil Armstrong in the lunar module Eagle shortly after his historic first moonwalk when he became the first human to set foot on a world besides Earth Michael Collins caught this photo of the lunar module with Armstrong and Aldrin inside  8211 and with Earth in the distance  8211 as the module ascended from the moon 8217  surface to rejoin the command module The lunar module docked with the orbiting command module and shortly afterwards the astronauts began their journey back to Earth There were no runway landings in those days Splashdown for the three astronauts was in the Pacific Ocean
