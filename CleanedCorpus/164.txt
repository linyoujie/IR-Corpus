Robert Wilde is a historian who writes about European history He is the author of the History in an Afternoon textbook series our editorial process Robert Wilde Updated February 11 2020 World War II ended with the unconditional surrender of Germany in May 1945 but both May 8 and May 9 are celebrated as Victory in Europe Day  r V  Day  This double celebration occurs because the Germans surrendered to the Western Allies including Britain and the U   on May 8 and a separate surrender took place on May 9 in Russia In the East the war ended when Japan surrendered unconditionally on Aug 14 1945 signing their surrender on Sept 2 The Japanese surrender occurred after the United States dropped atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki on Aug 6 and 9 respectively The date of the Japanese surrender is known as Victory Over Japan Day or V  Day The End in Europe Within two years after starting the war in Europe with his  invasion of Poland in 1939  Adolf Hitler  889–1945 had subjugated much of the continent including France after a lightning ast conquest Then Der Führer sealed his fate with a poorly thought ut invasion of the Soviet Union Joseph Stalin  878–1953 and the Soviet people did not concede although they had to overcome initial defeats Soon however the overextended Nazi forces were defeated at Stalingrad and the Soviets began to force them slowly back across Europe It took a long time and millions of deaths but the Soviets eventually pushed Hitler 39  forces all the way back to Germany In 1944 a new front was reopened in the West when Britain France the U   Canada and other allies landed in Normandy  Two enormous military forces approaching from the east and the west eventually wore the Nazis down Celebrating Victory In Berlin the Soviet forces were fighting their way through the German capital Hitler once the charismatic ruler of an empire was reduced to hiding in a bunker giving orders to forces that only existed in his head The Soviets were getting close to the bunker and on April 30 1945 Adolf Hitler killed himself Command of the German forces passed to Admiral Karl Doenitz  891–1980  and he quickly sent out peace feelers He soon realized an unconditional surrender would be required and he was ready to sign But with the war over the tenuous alliance between the U  and the Soviets was turning frosty a new wrinkle which would eventually lead to the Cold War While the Western Allies agreed to the surrender on May 8 the Soviets insisted on their own surrender ceremony and process This took place on May 9 the official end to what the USSR called the Great Patriotic War Victory in Japan Victory and surrender would not come easily for the Allies in the Pacific Theater The war in the Pacific had started with the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor in Hawaii on Dec 7 1941 After years of battles and unsuccessful attempts at negotiating a treaty the United States dropped atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in early Aug 1945 A week later on Aug 15 Japan announced its intention to surrender The Japanese foreign affairs minister Mamoru Shigemitsu  887–1957  signed the official document on Sept 2  Sources and Further Reading Feis Herbert  34 he
