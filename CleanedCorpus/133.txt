8212 n English mathematician logician and cryptanalyst 8212 as a computer pioneer Often remembered for his contributions to the fields of artificial intelligence and modern computer science  efore either even existed  Turing is probably best known for what is now dubbed the  8220 uring Test  221 It is a process of testing a machine 8217  ability to  8220 hink  221 The basic premise of the Turing Test is that a human judge would be placed in isolation and have two conversations  8211 one with a computer and one with another person  8211 except the judge wouldn 8217  be told which was which If the computer could fool the judge and carry on a conversation that is indistinguishable from that of the human the computer is said to have passed the Turing Test No computer has passed it yet Less is known however about Turing 8217  intelligence work during WWII when he used his mathematical and cryptologic skills to help break one of the most difficult of German ciphers ENIGMA  Codes and Ciphers Though often used interchangeably the terms codes and ciphers are very different A code changes the meaning of a word or phrase by replacing it with a different word or phrase to make a message secret A cipher  on the other hand makes a word or phrase secret by changing or rearranging the individual letters in a message Together codes and ciphers are called encryption ENIGMA was a cipher machine 8212 ach keystroke replaced a character in the message with another character determined by the machine 8217  rotor settings and wiring arrangements that were previously established between the sender and the receiver For additional security the German military services usually double ncrypted their messages by first substituting original text with code words and then enciphering the encoded text Breaking ENIGMA In the early years of WWII Turing worked at Britain 8217  code breaking headquarters in Bletchley Park In addition to mathematicians Bletchley Park also recruited linguists and chess champions and attracted talent by approaching winners of a complex crossword puzzle tournament held by The Daily Telegraph Turing 8217  mathematical and logic skills made him a natural cryptanalyst Whereas cryptographers write encryption systems and cryptologists study them cryptanalysts like Turing break them In 1939 Turing created a method called  8220 he bombe  221 an electromechanical device that could detect the settings for ENIGMA allowing the Allied powers to decipher German encryptions Turing and his colleagues were also able to break the more complicated Naval ENIGMA system which from 1941 943 helped the Allies avoid German U oats during the Battle of the Atlantic Poland was actually the first to realize that the solution to breaking ENIGMA would most likely be discovered by a mathematician Polish cryptanalysts as early as 1932 could decode German ciphers and by 1939 they were able to successfully decipher messages written with an earlier version of ENIGMA using a replica machine like  8220 he bombe 8221 that could emulate the way ENIGMA worked When Poland was overrun by Germany in September 1939 the Polish as well as French cryptanalysts shared what they knew about ENIGMA with the UK which allowed the cryptanalysts at Bletchley Park including Turing to finally crack the ENIGMA ciphers Once the German messages were decrypted the British began supplying the Office of Strategic Services  SS precursor to CIA with extensive information about foreign military espionage and sabotage activities The most sensitive intelligence came from ULTRA 8212 he code name applied to all intel coming from Bletchley Park including the intercepts of German military messages sent with the ENIGMA machine Because of the volume of the traffic and the overriding need for compartmentalization the British insisted that the OSS set up a separate extra ecure component to handle the material On March 1 1943 OSS Director William J Donovan created the Counterintelligence Division in the Secret Intelligence Branch 8212 he first centralized national evel counterintelligence office in US intelligence history and the predecessor of CIA 8217  Counterintelligence Staff and Counterintelligence Center  The Demise and Recognition of Alan Turing Turing 8217  work at Bletchley Park was vital in ending the war General Dwight D Eisenhower told the British intelligence chief in July 1945 that ULTRA  8220 aved thousands of British and American lives and in no small way contributed to the speed with which the enemy was routed and eventually agreed to surrender  221 Nevertheless Turing would spend the majority of his career focused on what would eventually become modern day computing He was posted to serve with the US Navy 8217  Cryptanalytic Section for several months in 1943 where he met and discussed mathematical models of communication and computation with Claude Shannon  he father of information theory  To this day our communications networks are built on top of Shannon  ideas while our computing devices processors and chips are built upon Turing  ideas Turing 8217  contribution to modern computing was so significant that the prestigious A  Turing Award 8212 ometimes known as the  8220 obel Prize 8221 of Computer Science 8212 s named after him In 1952 Turing was convicted of acts of  8220 ross indecency 8221 after he admitted to a sexual relationship with a young Manchester man who lived with him for a brief period in England Turing was able to avoid jail time but he lost his security clearances and was required to undergo  8220 hemical sterilization 8221 through hormone therapy In 2013 more than 60 years after his conviction Turing was granted a rare formal pardon by Queen Elizabeth II Turing died tragically in 1954 from cyanide poisoning  60 is death was officially declared a suicide although some people believe it was an accident from a chemistry experiment It wasn 8217  until the 1970s that the story of ENIGMA was declassified and Turing could be recognized for his significant contributions to modern computer science the world of cryptography and the defeat of the Axis powers in WWII
