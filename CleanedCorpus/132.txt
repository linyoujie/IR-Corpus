Brief History of the ENIAC Computer A look back at the room ize government computer that began the digital era  uy Billout By Steven Levy Smithsonian Magazine  Subscribe November 2013 Philadelphia schoolchildren are drilled on the names of its accomplished citizens William Penn Benjamin Franklin Betsy Ross But during all the baby oomer years I attended schools in the City of Brotherly Love none of my teachers mentioned J Presper Eckert Jr It was not until the mid 970s when I was in my 20s that I learned that Gatsbian moniker 8212  8217  write it every month on a rent check for a one edroom apartment in the Germantown section of the city It was only when I became a technology writer some years later that I realized that my landlord had invented the computer Related Content Computer Programming Used To Be Women's Work In the early 1940s John Presper  8220 res 8221 Eckert Jr was a grad student at the Moore School of Engineering  ffiliated with the University of Pennsylvania  A professor John W Mauchly had circulated some memos about how a powerful new kind of electronic calculator could produce benefits to the war effort in areas like setting munitions trajectories When the Army 8217  Ordnance Ballistic Research Laboratory approved the project Eckert became the driving force behind what experts now consider to be the world 8217  first digital general urpose computer As summarized by Herman Goldstine a pioneering contemporary  8220 ckert 8217  contribution  xceeded all others As chief engineer he was the mainspring of the entire mechanism  221 The idea of huge computing machines was in the air at that time In late 1939 Harvard professor Howard Aiken was building the Mark 1 a giant calculator At Bletchley Park in England cryptographers would oversee the construction of a special urpose code reaking machine called Colossus In 1941 Mauchly himself had discussed the field with an Iowa State professor named John V Atanasoff who had plans to build his own huge calculating machine  ut never completed the task  What distinguished Eniac from the others was that a working machine performing thousands of calculations a second could be easily reprogrammed for different tasks It was a breathtaking enterprise The original cost estimate of  50 00 would rise to  00 00 Weighing in at 30 tons the U haped construct filled a 1 00 quare oot room Its 40 cabinets each of them nine feet high were packed with 18 00 vacuum tubes 10 00 capacitors 6 00 switches and 1 00 relays Looking at the consoles observers could see a tangle of patch cords that reminded them of a telephone exchange But by the time Eniac was completed the war was over The machine did not boot up until November 1945 when 300 neon lights attached to accumulators lit up a basement room at the Moore School Two 20 orsepower blowers exhaled cool air so that Eniac wouldn 8217  melt down On February 14 1946 the government released Eniac from its shroud of secrecy  8220  new machine that is expected to revolutionize the mathematics of engineering and change many of our industrial design methods was announced today by the War Department  221 began an Army press release It described a  8220 athematical robot 8221 working at  8220 henomenal 8221 speed that  8220 rees scientific thought from the drudgery of lengthy calculating work  221 Subsequent years were not kind to the inventors Mauchly and Eckert began the first commercial computer corporation building an Eniac successor But their firm struggled and the pair sold the company to Sperry Rand Worse a rival operation Honeywell cited John Atanasoff 8217  work in an attempt to invalidate the Eniac patent Though the Iowan 8217  never ompleted computer was not a general urpose machine and lacked many of Eniac 8217  groundbreaking attributes  ike a  8220 lock 8221 that governed the timing of computational events  Honeywell launched a court battle that led a judge to declare Atanasoff the true inventor of the computer That blow forever haunted Mauchly and Eckert Meanwhile Eniac itself was broken up with sections on display at Penn and the Smithsonian It finally got its rightful recognition in 1996 fifty years to the day after the government revealed its existence The city of Philadelphia finally alerted to the fact that it could claim to be not just the cradle of the Constitution but of computation as well hosted festivities  ncluding the first exhibition match between an Eniac descendant IBM 8217  Deep Blue computer and the world chess champion Garry Kasparov  Enough of Eniac had survived at Penn to perform some work Vice President Al Gore threw a switch and the remaining pieces clattered out the answer to an addition problem Now such calculations occur billions of times a second in devices that fit in our pockets Eckert used to joke about that phenomenon  8220 ow would you like to have most of your life 8217  work end up on a square centimeter of silicon  221 But the question could easily have been put another way How would you like to have invented the machine that changed the course of civilization I didn 8217  get to ask that question of the man whose name I used to write on rent checks Pres Eckert died of leukemia less than a year before Eniac 8217  50th anniversary event I met his widow there however Judy Eckert told me that the family still owned the apartment building in Germantown An editor for Wired  Steven Levy defined what became known as the  8220 acker ethic 8221 in his seminal 1984 book Hackers Heroes of the Computer Revolution  Like this article
