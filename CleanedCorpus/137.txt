even get the chance to make it this far When Steve Jobs took over as CEO of Apple in 1997 the company had been struggling to find its legs in a market increasingly dominated by Microsoft and its partners  A0 Indeed Michael Dell himself once quipped that if he were in Jobs pos shoes he pos  shut Apple down and return the money to the shareholders  A0 Here pos  a look into the history of Apple in photos from its inception through its hard times and through to the triumphant return of Jobs  A0 Apple was cofounded on April 1 1976 by Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak in Los Altos California Kimberly White  REUTERS There was a third cofounder too named Ronald Wayne Jobs brought Wayne on board to provide business guidance for the two young cofounders but he ended up leaving the company

company x27  first product was the Apple I which was just a motherboard with a processor and some memory intended for hobbyists Customers had to build their own case and add their own keyboard and monitor as seen in the picture It sold for  66 6 — seriously Wikimedia Commons The Apple I was invented by Wozniak who also hand uilt every kit Here you can see his hand rawn design diagrams for the Apple I computer Wikimedia Commons Meanwhile Jobs handled the business end mainly trying to convince would e investors that the personal computer market was primed to explode Eventually Jobs would bring in Mike Markkula who made a crucial  50 00 angel investment and came to work for Apple as employee No 3 with a one hird share in the company Jobs and Markkula Digibarn Apple would officially incorporate in 1977 thanks to guidance from Markkula A man named Michael Scott  o not the one from  uot he Office uot  was brought in at Markkula x27  suggestion to serve as the company x27  first president and CEO The thought was that Jobs was too young and undisciplined to serve as CEO Michael Scott 1977 also saw the introduction of the Apple II the personal computer designed by Wozniak that would go on to take the world by storm Flickr mahender The Apple II x27  killer app was VisiCalc a groundbreaking spreadsheet software that propelled the computer ahead of market leaders Tandy and Commodore With VisiCalc Apple could sell the Apple II to the business customer Wikimedia Commons By 1978 Apple would actually have a real office with employees and an Apple II production line This was also around the time some early Apple employees grew tired of prolonged exposure to the famously difficult Jobs From left Elmer Baum Mike Markkula Gary Martin Andre Dubois Steve Jobs Sue Cabannis Mike

share Wikimedia Commons In 1980 Apple released the Apple III a business ocused computer that was supposed to compete with the growing threat of IBM and Microsoft But the Apple III was only a stopgap and Xerox PARC had gotten the young Jobs thinking in a different direction   Flickr tiefkind Xerox PARC convinced Jobs that the future of computing was with a graphical user interface  UI  like the kind we x27 e used to today Apple Jobs xA0 pearheaded the effort to equip Apple pos  next eneration Lisa computer with a GUI but was bumped from the project thanks to infighting Lisa was released in

managed to bring him to Apple with the now egendary pitch  uot o you want to sell sugared water for the rest of your life Or do you want to come with me and change the world quot In 1984 Apple would release the TV commercial that would make it a household name This ad appropriately called  uot 984 quot was directed by Ridley Scott and cost the company    million It aired during the third quarter of Super Bowl XVIII and never again  xA0 This was also when tensions between Jobs and Bill Gates started to run high Originally Microsoft was working hard at making software for the Macintosh But those plans were scuttled in 1983 when Microsoft revealed that it too was working on a graphical user interface called Windows Business Insider The Macintosh had strong sales but not enough to break IBM x27  dominance This led to a lot of friction between Jobs — the head of the Macintosh group who liked doing things his own way — and Sculley who wanted stricter oversight on future products in the light of the Lisa disaster and disappointment of the Macintosh Jobs Sculley and Wozniak Sal Veder  AP Images It got to the point that Apple pos  board specifically instructed Sculley to  uot ontain uot Jobs Things came to a head in 1985 when Jobs tried to stage a coup and oust Sculley — but Apple x27  board of directors took Sculley x27  side and removed Jobs from his managerial duties A furious

great and Apple introduced its PowerBook laptop and System 7 operating system in 1991 System 7 introduced color to the Macintosh operating system and would stick around  ith updates until OS X was released in 2001 Associated Press The 1990s would see Apple get into lots of new markets none of which really worked out Possibly the most famous Apple flop of the  x27 0s was  x27 3 x27  Newton MessagePad which was Sculley x27  own brainchild It literally created the market for  uot ersonal digital assistants quot but it was  00 and did little more than take notes and keep track of your

of the dominant Intel processor architecture Most software was written for Intel processors plus they got cheaper and cheaper over the years Mac System 7 GUI Guidebook At the same time Microsoft x27

Between the high rofile flops and the costly decision to move to PowerPC Apple x27  board had had enough After Apple missed on its first quarter earnings in 1993 Sculley was fired and replaced as CEO by Michael Spindler a German expatriate who had been with Apple since 1980 YouTube Spindler had the unfortunate job of following through with Sculley x27  big PowerPC mistake In 1994 the first Macintosh running on a PowerPC was released But Apple x27  fortunes continued to sag as Windows took off After acquisition talks with IBM Sun MicroSystems and Philips all fell through Apple x27  board
