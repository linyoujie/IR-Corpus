tendency of mostbodies to fall to earth  In contrast hings that leaped upwards like flames of fire were said to have"levity"  Aristotle was the first writerto attempt a quantitative description of falling motion he wrote that anobject fell at a constant speed attained shortly after being released andheavier things fell faster in proportion to their mass Of course this isnonsense but in his defense falling motion is pretty fast x2014 t's hardto see the speed variation when you drop something to the ground  Aristotle most likely observed the slowermotion of things falling through water where buoyancy and fluid resistancedominate and assumed that to be a slowed own version of falling through air x2014 hich itisn't Galileo was the first to get it right   rue others had improved on Aristotle butGalileo was the first to get the big picture  He realized that a falling body picked up speed at a constant rate  x2014 n otherwords it had constant acceleration  s he termed it the word means"addition of speed" in Italian   He also made the crucial observation that ifair resistance and buoyancy can be neglected all bodies fall with the sameacceleration  bodies of different weights dropped together reach the groundat the same time  This was arevolutionary idea x2014 s was hisassertion that it should be checked by experiment rather than by the traditional method of trying to decipher what ancientauthorities might have meant Galileo also noted that if a ball rolls without interferenceon a smooth horizontal surface and friction and air resistance can beneglected it will move with constant speed in a fixed direction x2014 n modernlanguage its velocity remains constant  He considered the motion of an object when not subject tointerference as its" natural" motion Using his terminology then natural horizontal motion is motion at constant velocity  and natural vertical motion isfalling at constant acceleration  But he didn't stop there x2014 e took animportant further step which made him the first in history to derive usefulquantitative results about motion useful that is to his boss a duke withmilitary interests  The crucial step wasthe realization that for a cannonball in flight the horizontal and verticalmotions can be analyzed independently  Here's his picture of the path of a horizontally fired cannonball animation here   The vertical drop of the cannonball at the end of successiveseconds the lengths of the vertical lines ci  df  eh are the same vertical distances fallen by something dropped fromrest  If you drop a cannonball over acliff it will fall 5 meters in the first second if you fire it exactlyhorizontally at 100 meters per second it will still fall 5 meters below a horizontal line in the firstsecond  Meanwhile its horizontal motionwill be at a steady speed  gain neglecting air resistance  it will go 100meters in the first second another 100 meters in the next second and so on  Vertically it falls 5 meters in the firstsecond 20 meters total in two seconds then 45 and so on  Galileo drew the graph above of the cannonball's position asa function of time and proved the curve was parabolic He went on to work outthe range for given muzzle velocity and any angle of firing much to the gratification of his employer Moving Up  NewtonPuts the Cannon on a Very High Mountain Newtonasked the question  what if we put thecannon on a really high  maginary of course  mountain above the atmosphereand fired the cannon really fast   The cannonball would still fall 5 meters inthe first second  gnoring the minor point that g goes down a bit on areally high mountain  but if it's going fast enough don't forget thecurvature of the earth  The surface ofthe earth curves away below a horizontal line so if we choose the right speed fter one second the cannonball will have reached a point where the earth'ssurface itself has dropped away by 5 meters below the originally horizontalstraight line  In that case the cannonballwon't have lost any height at all x2014 efining"height" as distance above the earth's surface  Furthermore"vertically down" has turned around a bit  tmeans perpendicular to the earth's surface so the cannonball is still moving"horizontally" eaning moving parallel to the earth's surface directly beneath it  And since it's above the earth's atmosphere t won't have lost any speed so exactly the same thing happens in the nextsecond and the next x2014 t thereforegoes in a circular path  Newton had foreseen how asatellite would move x2014 ere's hisown drawing with VD VE and VF representing the paths of successively fastershots  Newton'sbrilliant insight x2014 he abovepicture x2014 s fullyanimated in my applet here  We can find how fast the cannonball must move to maintainthe circular orbit by using Pythagoras' theorem in the diagram below  hichgrossly exaggerates the speed so that you can see how to do the proof  The cannonball fired from point P goes v  meters horizontally in one second and drops 5meters vertically and if v  has the right value the cannonball will stillbe the same distance R  from the earth's center it was at thebeginning of the second    ear in mindthat v  is actually about a thousandth of R   so the change in the direction of"down" willbe imperceptible not like the exaggerated figure here  Knowing that the radius of the earth R  is 6400 km there is enough information in theabove diagram to fix the value of v    Noticethat there is a right angled triangle with sides R  and v  and hypoteneuse R  5   Applying Pythagoras' theorem  R  5  2  R 2  v 2  R 2  10 R  25  R 2  v 2  Newton knew  n different units that R   6400 km so the 25 in the above equation canbe neglected to give v 2  10 R  10  x00D7 6400  x00D7 1000   x00A0 o x00A0 v  8000   The units for v  are of course meters per second on ourdiagram we show v  as a distance that traveled in the firstsecond So the cannonball must move at 8 km per second or 5 milesper second if its falling is to match the earth's curvature x2014 his is18 00 mph once round the earth in a little less than an hour and a half  This is in fact about right for a satellite inlow earth orbit Onward into Space The Cannonball and the Moon It occurred to Newton one day  ossibly because of a fallingapple that this familiar gravitational force we experience all the time herenear the surface of the earth might extend outwards as far as the moon and infact might be the reason the moon is in a circular orbit The radius of themoon's orbit  84 00 km and its speed in orbit  bout 1 km per second hadlong been known  ee my notes here if you're interested in how it was measured  so it was easy to find using thesame Pythagorean arguments as used for the cannonball above that the moon"falls" 1 7 millimeters below a straight line trajectory in one second That is to say the ratioof the moon's acceleration towards the center of the earth to the cannonball'sis 1 7 000 or about 1 600  But the radius of the moon's orbit is about 60 times greater than the cannonball's  hich is just the radius of the earth approximately   Since 60×60  3600  Newton concluded that the gravitational forcedecreased with distance as 1  r 2      Newton'sUniversal Law of Gravitation Newtonthen boldly extrapolated from the earth the apple and the moon to everything sserting his  Universal Law ofGravitation Every body in theuniverse attracts every other body with a gravitational force that decreaseswith distance as 1  r 2    But actually he knew more about the gravitational force rom the fact that bodies of different masses near the earth's surfaceaccelerate downwards at the same rate using F  m a   is Second Law if two bodies of differentmasses have the same acceleration they must be feeling forces in the same ratioas their masses  o a body twice as massive feels twice the gravitationalforce  that is the gravitational force of attraction a body feels must beproportional to its mass   Now suppose we are considering the gravitational attractionbetween two bodies  s we always are  one of mass m 1   one of mass m 2   By Newton'sThird Law the force body 1 feels from 2 is equal in magnitude  ut of courseopposite in direction to that 2 feels from 1 If we think of m 1  as the earth the force m 2  feels is proportional to m 2   as argued above x2014 o thismust be true whatever m 1  is And since the situation is perfectlysymmetrical the force must also be proportional to m 1    Putting all this together the magnitude of thegravitational force between two bodies of masses m 1  and m 2  a distance r  apart F  G m 1 m 2 r 2    The constant G     bsp  7×10  1 N  2  g 2  It is important to realize that G   cannotbe measured by any astronomical observations   For example g  at the surface of the earth is given by g  G m E r E 2    Here m E  is the mass and r E  the radius of the earth Notice that bymeasuring g   and knowing r E   we can find G m E    Butthis does not tell us what G  is since we don't know m E   It turns out that this same problem arises withevery astronomical observation Timing the planets around the sun will give us G m Sun    So we can figure out the ratio of thesun's mass to the earth's but we can't find an absolute value for either one The first measurement of G  was made in 1798 by Cavendish a century afterNewton's work avendish measured the tiny attractive force between lead spheres of knownmass  For details on how an experimentat the University of Virginia in 1969improved on Cavendish's work click on the UVa Physics site here  Cavendish said he was" weighing the earth" becauseonce G  was measured he could immediately find themass of the earth m E  from g  G m E  r E 2    andthen go on the find the mass of the sun etc Describing the Solar System Kepler's Laws Newton's first clue that gravitation between bodies fell asthe inverse quare of the distance may have come from comparing a falling appleto the falling moon but important support for his idea was provided by adetailed description of planetary orbits constructed half a century earlier byJohannes Kepler  Kepler had inherited from Tycho Brahe a huge set of preciseobservations of planetary motions across the sky spanning decades  Kepler himself spent eight yearsmathematically analyzing the observations of the motion of Mars beforerealizing that Mars was moving in an elliptical path To appreciate fully how Kepler's discovery confirmed Newton's theory it isworthwhile to review some basic properties of ellipses Mathematical Interlude Ellipses 101 A circle can bedefined as the set of all points which are the same distance R  from a given point so a circle of radius 1centered at the origin O is the setof all points distance 1 from O  An ellipse can bedefined as the set of all points such that the sum of the distances from two fixed points is a constant length hich must obviously be greater than the distance between the twopoints   This is sometimes called thegardener's definition to set the outline of an elliptic flower bed in a lawn  gardener would drive in two stakes tie a loose rope between them then pullthe rope tight in all different directions to form the outline In the diagram the stakes are at F 1  F 2  the red lines are the rope  P  is an arbitrary point on the ellipse C A   iscalled the semimajor axis length a    C B   thesemi inor axis length b      F 1  F 2   arecalled the foci  lural of focus  Notice first that thestring has to be of length 2 a    becauseit must stretch along the major axis from F 1  to A  then back to F 2   and for that configuration there's a doublelength of string along F 2 A  and a single length from F 1  to F 2   But the length A  x2032 F 1     isthe same as F 2 A   so the total length of string is the same asthe total length   A  x2032 A  2 a     Suppose now we put P  at B    Since F 1 B  B F 2   and the string has length 2 a     the length F 1 B  a      We get a useful result by applying Pythagoras' theorem tothe triangle F 1 B C     F 1 C  2  a 2  x2212 b 2   e shall use this shortly  Evidently for a circle F 1 C  0   The eccentricity of the ellipse is defined as theratio of F 1 C  to a    so eccentricity e  F 1 C  a   x200A 1  x2212  b  a  2  The eccentricity of a circle is zero The eccentricity of along thin ellipse is just below one F 1    and F 2  on the diagram are called the foci of the ellipse  lural of focus  because if a point source oflight is placed at F 1   and the ellipse is a mirror it will reflect x2014 ndtherefore focus  x2014 ll thelight to F 2     hiscan be proved using the string construction  An ellipse is essentially a circle scaled shorter in onedirection in  x  y   coordinates it is described by the equation x 2 a 2  y 2 b 2  1   a circle being givenby   a  b    In fact in analyzing planetary motion it is more naturalto take the origin of coordinates at the center of the Sun rather than thecenter of the elliptical orbit  It isalso more convenient to take  r   x03B8   coordinates instead of  x  y   coordinates because the strength of thegravitational force depends only on  r     Therefore the relevant equation describing aplanetary orbit is the  r   x03B8   equation with the origin at one focus  For an ellipse of semi major axis a  and eccentricity e  the equation is a  1  x2212 e 2  r  1  e cos  x03B8  It is not difficult to prove that this is equivalent to thetraditional equation in terms of x  y  presented above Kepler summarized hisfindings about the solar system in his three laws 1  The planetsall move in elliptical orbits with the Sun at one focus 2  As a planetmoves in its orbit the line from the center of the Sun to the center of theplanet sweeps out equal areas in equal times so if the area S A B   ith curved side A B   equals the area S C D   the planet takes the same time to move from A  to B  as it does from C  to D    For my applet illustrating this law click here  bsp 3  The time ittakes a planet to make one complete orbit around the sun T   ne planet year is related to its averagedistance from the sun R    T 2  x221D R 3  In other words if a table is made of the length of year T  for each planet in the solar system and itsaverage distance from the sun R   and T 2  R 3  is computed for each planet the numbers areall the same These laws of Kepler's are precise but they are only descriptive  x2014 epler didnot understand why the planets shouldbehave in this way  Newton's great achievement was to prove thatall this complicated behavior was the consequence of one simple law ofattraction How Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation Explains Kepler's Laws Surprisingly the first of Kepler's laws x2014 hat theplanetary paths are elliptical x2014 s thetoughest to prove beginning with Newton'sassumption of inverse quare gravitation Newtonhimself did it with an ingenious geometrical argument famously difficult tofollow  It can be more easily provedusing calculus but even this is nontrivial and we shall not go through it inclass   he proof is given later inthese notes if you're curious to see how it's done  The best strategy turns out to be to attack the laws inreverse order Kepler's Third Law  ell for circular orbits It is easy to show how Kepler's Third Law follows from theinverse square law if we assume the planets move in perfect circles which they almost do The acceleration of aplanet moving at speed v  in a circular orbit of radius R  is v 2  R  towards the center   f course you already know this but it isamusing to see how easy it is to prove using the Pythagoras diagram above justreplace the 5 meters by 1 2 a t 2   the"horizontal" distance v  by v t   write down Pythagoras' theorem and take thelimit of a very small time  Newton'sSecond Law F  m a  for a planet in orbit becomes m v 2 R  G M m R 2  Now the time for one orbit is T  2  x03C0 R  v   so dividing both sides of the equation aboveby R   we find  T 2  x03C0  2  R 3 G M   x2003 so x00A0 T 2 R 3  4  x03C0 2 G M  This is Kepler's Third Law T 2  R 3  has the same numerical value for all the sun'splanets Exercise  how are R  T  related if the gravitational force isproportional to 1  R   to 1  R 3  o R  The point of theexercise is that Kepler's Third Law based on observation forces us to the conclusionthat the Law of Gravity is indeed inverse square In fact Newton went further x2014 egeneralized the proof to elliptic orbits and established that for the inversesquare law the circle radius R  must  or ellipses be replaced by a   the semimajor axis of the ellipse that is tosay T 2  a 3  is the same for all planets  This is in fact exactly what Kepler found tobe the case  It  follows immediately that all elliptic orbitswith the same major axis length whatever their eccentricity have the same orbital time Kepler's Second Law A planet in its patharound the sun sweeps out equal areas in equal times Suppose at a given instant of time the planet is at point P in its orbit moving with a velocity v  x2192  meters per second in the direction along thetangent at P  ee figure   In the next second it will move v meters essentially along this line he distance is of course greatly exaggerated in the figure so the area sweptout in that second is that of the triangle SPQ  here S is the center of the sun Fig23 The areaof triangle SPQ is just  x00BD  base ×height  The base PQ is v  meterslong the height is the perpendicular distance r  x22A5  fromthe vertex of the triangle at the sun S to the baseline PQ  which is just thetangential velocity vector v  x2192  Hence rate ofsweeping out of area  1 2 r  x22A5 v  Comparing this with the angular momentum L  of the planet as it moves around the sun L  m v  x200A r  x22A5 it becomes apparent that Kepler's Second Law the constancyof the area sweeping rate is telling us that the angular momentum of the planet around the sun is constant  In fact rate of sweeping outof area  L 2 m  To see what this constancy of angular momentum means think of applying a force to a wheelon a fixed axle If the force is above the axle as shown the wheel willbegin to turn anticlockwise if it is below the axle the wheel will turn theother way x2014 ssumingno friction the rate of change of angular momentum is equal to the torque theproduct of the magnitude of the force and the perpendicular distance of theline of action of the force from the center of rotation the axle  If the line of action of the force passesthrough the middle of the axle there is no torque no rotation no change ofangular momentum For the planet in orbit the fact that the angular momentumabout the sun does not change means that the force acting on the planet has notorque around the sun x2014 he forceis directly towards the sun  This nowseems obvious but Kepler himself thought the planets were pushed around theirorbits by spokes radiating out from the sun Newtonrealized that Kepler's Second Law showed this was wrong x2014 he forcemust be directly towards the sun   Calculus Derivation of Kepler's First Law Note I'm including this derivation of the elliptic orbitjust so you can see that it's calculus not magic that gives this result  This is an optional section and will notappear on any exams We now back up to Kepler's First Law proof that theorbit is in fact an ellipse if the gravitational force is inverse square  As usual we begin with Newton's Second Law F  x2192  m a  x2192   in vector form The force is G M m  r 2  in a radial inward direction But what is the radialacceleration  Is it just d 2 r  d t 2    Well no because if the planet's moving in acircular orbit it's still accelerating inwards at r  x03C9 2   ame as v 2  r   even though r  is not changing at all The total accelerationis the sum  so m a  x2192  F  x2192  becomes  d 2 r d t 2  x2212 r  x03C9 2   x2212 G M r 2 This isn't ready to integrate yet because  x03C9  varies too  n the elliptical case   But since the angular momentum L  is constant and L  m r 2  x03C9   e can get rid of  x03C9  in the equation to give d 2 r d t 2   x2212 G M r 2  r  L m r 2  2   x2212 G M r 2  L 2 m 2 r 3   This equation can be integrated using two very unobvioustricks figured out by hindsight  Thefirst is to change go from the variable r   to itsinverse u  1  r   The other is to use the constancy of angularmomentum to change the variable t  to  x03B8  Anyway L  m r 2  x03C9  m u 2 d  x03B8 d t so d d t  d  x03B8 d t d d  x03B8  L u 2 m d d  x03B8  Therefore d r d t  d d t  1 u    x2212 1 u 2 d u d t   x2212 L m d u d  x03B8 and similarly d 2 r d t 2   x2212 L 2 u 2 m 2 d 2 u d  x03B8 2  Substituting in the equation of motion gives d 2 u d  x03B8 2  u  G M m 2 L 2 This equation is easy to solve  The solution is u  1 r  G M m 2 L 2  A cos  x03B8 where A  is a constant of integration determined bythe initial conditions  This is equivalent tothe standard  r   x03B8   equation of an ellipse of semi major axis a  and eccentricity e    withthe origin at one focus which is a  1  x2212 e 2  r  1  e cos  x03B8  Deriving Kepler's Third Law for Elliptical Orbits The time it takes a planet to make one complete orbit aroundthe Sun T   ne planet year is related to the semi ajoraxis a  of its elliptic orbit by T 2  x221D  x2009  x2009 a 3  We have already shown how this can be proved for circularorbits however since we have gone to the trouble of deriving the  r   x03B8   formula for an elliptic orbit we add here the ptional proof for that more general case  ote that this same result is derived in the next lectureusing energy and angular momentum conservation x2014 he proofgiven here is quicker but depends on knowing the  r   x03B8   equation for the ellipse  The area of an ellipse is  x03C0 a b   and the rate of sweeping out of area is L  2 m   so the time T  for a complete orbit is evidently T   x03C0 a b L  2 m  Putting the equation 1 r  G M m 2 L 2  A cos  x03B8 in the standard form a  1  x2212 e 2  r  1  e cos  x03B8  we find L 2  G M m 2  a  1  x2212 e 2   Now the top point B  of the semi inor axis of the ellipse  ee thediagram above must be exactly a  from F 1   isualize the string F 1 B F 2    so using Pythagoras' theorem for thetriangle F 1 O B  we find b 2  a 2  1  x2212 e 2   Using the two equations above the square of the orbitaltime T 2   2 m  x03C0 a b  2  L 2   2 m  x03C0 a b  2  G M m 2 a  1  x2212 e 2    2 m  x03C0 a b  2  G M m 2 a  b 2  a 2   4  x03C0 2 a 3  G M  We have established hen that the time for one orbit depends only on the semimajor axis ofthe orbit it does not depend on how eccentric the orbit is  index  bsp nbsp next  bsp nbsp PDF
